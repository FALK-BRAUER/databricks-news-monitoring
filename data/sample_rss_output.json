    "title": "The Toy Startups Getting Funded This Year: Talking Dinosaurs, Sticker Cubes And Tin Can Phones",
    "description": "AI-enabled toys are gaining traction this holiday season, but we are simultaneously seeing renewed interest in older technologies including analog toys and screen-free gadgets.",
    "content": "<p>It’s that time of year again, where parents are frantically looking for the new cool thing to wrap up and surprise their kids with this holiday season. The choices are more diverse than ever, especially as artificial intelligence has been increasingly incorporated into children&#8217;s toys.</p>\n<p>What is intriguing, however, is that while AI-enabled toys are gaining traction, we are simultaneously seeing renewed interest in older technologies, including analog toys and screen-free gadgets. There is also a movement toward toys that are more than mere playthings, but also models of cultural learning and identity.</p>\n<p>While Crunchbase data shows the toy industry overall doesn&#8217;t receive much in the way of venture dollars, there are some companies in the space getting investor cash, many with an AI angle. So as we head into the holiday season, we thought it would be fun to see what funded startups in the toy space are selling this year, and some of the trends catching investor attention. (I’m of the age where I mostly got Barbies and Play-Doh, so all of these cool new toys are extra fascinating to me.)</p>\n<h2>AI-enabled</h2>\n<p>It’s no surprise that artificial intelligence has made its way into the toy industry, as it is infiltrating seemingly every industry in one way or another. While there’s still plenty of debate about the potential risks and drawbacks of AI technologies aimed at children, the AI toys market is projected to nearly triple to $6.4 billion by 2032, up from $2.2 billion in 2024, according to a recent <a href=\"https://www.credenceresearch.com/report/smart-ai-toys-market\">report</a> from <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/credence-research\">Credence Research</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the funded startups marketing an AI-enabled toy for youngsters this holiday season is <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bondu\">Bondu</a>. In early October, the company unveiled its AI-powered conversational companion in the form of a stuffed dinosaur. According to <a href=\"https://gamesbeat.com/ai-toy-startup-raises-5-3-million-to-launch-emotionally-intelligent-companion-for-kids-named-bondu/\">GamesBeat</a>, the new toy is designed “to help children learn, imagine, and grow through safe, interactive play.” The startup has raised $5.3 million in a seed funding round led by <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/makers-fund\">Makers Fund</a> with participation from <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/samsung-ventures\">Samsung Ventures</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/boostfunder\">Boost VC</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/founders-c414\">Founders Inc.</a></p>\n<p>Bondu is not cheap. The toy costs $199.99, but hey, at least it comes in four different colors. Ironically, even though the toy is powered by AI, the company is<a href=\"https://sfstandard.com/2025/11/01/ai-toys-talking-stuffed-animals/\"> touting it as a way of helping your kids “say goodbye to screens.”</a></p>\n<p>Some of the things Bondu can do, according to its manufacturer: help kids learn by having “conversations” in which it answers questions and teaches facts and can reply back to a child in 32 languages. Parents can even use the toy to set reminders in an effort to motivate their kids to do boring tasks such as brushing their teeth.</p>\n<p>Another startup funded this year that offers a screenless, conversational, AI-powered toy is <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/roybi\">Roybi</a>, a San Jose, California-based maker of a companion robot for young children. The company, which has raised $4.3 million to date, likewise touts a companion that it says can help young children with language development (English, Spanish, French and Mandarin), and math and science skills.</p>\n<p>The funded companies are examples of growing investor interest in embedding conversational AI into physical toys.</p>\n<p>More recently, another AI-enabled startup, New York-based <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/stickerbox-adec\">Stickerbox</a>, managed to raise $7 million in seed funding in just two months after co-founder <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/robert-whitney-85a2\">Robert Whitney</a>’s 4-year-old son asked: “Can we make our own coloring sheets?”</p>\n<p>That question prompted Whitney, an alumnus of <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/anthropic\">Anthropic</a>, to join co-founder and CEO <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/arun-gupta-a667\">Arun Gupta</a> (formerly of <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/grailed\">Grailed</a>) to start Stickerbox, a toy company that claims it has developed the first-ever voice-powered AI creativity tool for kids.</p>\n<p>Investors such as <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/maveron\">Maveron</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ai2-incubator-dc48\">AI2 Incubator</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/matt-brezina\">Matthew Brezina</a> and tennis legend <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/serena-williams\">Serena Williams</a>’ <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/serena-ventures\">Serena Ventures</a> wrote checks into the startup to help it grow.</p>\n<p>The Stickerbox is <a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/interesting-deals-month-ai-robotic-arms-artificial-retina-healthcare/\">pretty much like what it sounds like</a>: A cube that prints stickers. Children deliver prompts for images with their voices. Importantly, the company says, the box doesn’t collect voice data and doesn’t have a camera.</p>\n<p>Like many other popular techie toys these days, including the <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/yoto\">Yoto</a> and Toniebox audio players, Stickerbox also emphasizes that while it’s tech-enabled, it’s screen free, meaning it doesn’t come with many of the <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10353947/\">drawbacks associated with excess screentime for children’s developing brains.</a></p>\n<h2>What’s old is new again</h2>\n<p>The move away from screens is another trend that’s attracting investor interest.</p>\n<p>Case in point: In September, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/far-homes\">Tin Can</a>, which has created a landline-style WiFi telephone for children, raised $3.5 million in funding. For those of us who remember the days of phones with actual cords, there is something nostalgic about the idea behind <a href=\"https://tincan.kids/\">Tin Can</a>. Essentially, the Seattle-based startup is tapping into a trend where parents want simpler, more “analog” devices for kids so they can slowly back away from the screens and participate in more direct communication.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/psl-ventures\">PSL Ventures</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/newfund-management\">Newfund Capital</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mother-ventures\">Mother Ventures</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/solid-foundations\">Solid Foundations</a> all felt compelled to fund the company.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/greg-gottesman\">Greg Gottesman</a>, managing director at Seattle-based PSL, told <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2025/landline-inspired-phone-startup-raises-3-5m-investor-calls-it-one-of-the-most-viral-businesses-i-have-seen/\">GeekWire</a> that he believes Tin Can is “one of the fastest growing and most viral businesses” he’s seen in over 25 years of investing.</p>\n<p>Personally, I <em>love</em> the idea of these colorful phones that are shaped like, you guessed it, oversized tin cans. Kids can actually talk to each other without a screen or via text. One might argue that kids can talk to each other with cellular phones. But to that, I argue back, cellphones still have screens.</p>\n<p>I’m rooting for this one.</p>\n<h2>Other trends: Subscriptions and cultural ties</h2>\n<p>Two other trends we’ve spotted in our perusal of funded companies in the toy space: Those that tap into cultural heritage, and subscription offerings aimed at reducing clutter.</p>\n<p>In October, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gubbachhi\">Gubbachhi</a>, a toy brand offering handcrafted, eco-friendly toys inspired by Indian culture and heritage, raised an undisclosed amount of funding from <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/d2c-insider-angels\">D2C Insider Angels</a>. The nod to promoting culture is one to be applauded.</p>\n<p>And last but not least: We all know how easily kids can get bored with toys. They’ll play with one toy for two months straight, only to discard it with not so much as a glance at it again.</p>\n<p>A startup called <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/orbit-crates\">Orbit Crates</a> has the solution for frustrated parents who are tired of seeing discarded toys strewn all over the house, cluttering up rooms and taking up space — not to mention the money wasted on toys that are only played with for a short time before their child loses interest and moves on.</p>\n<p>Started by mother of three <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/kim-conti-1b25\">Kim Conti</a>, ​​Orbit Crates is a subscription toy-rental company designed for children aged newborn to 6. The startup, according to <a href=\"https://today.uconn.edu/2025/09/wolff-finalist-startup-orbit-crates-offers-subscription-toy-rentals-for-kids/\">UConn Toda</a>y, “has almost 500 toys in stock, from classic wooden toys to Bluey and <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/the-walt-disney-company\">Disney</a> princesses.” The startup participated in the <a href=\"https://today.uconn.edu/2025/10/wolff-competition-awards-grand-prize-to-company-using-seaweed-to-replace-plastic/\">Wolff New Venture Competition</a> in October, winning the $5,000 Mark and Jamie Summer Innovation Award.</p>\n<p>In India, a similar toy rental startup called <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/toyflix\">ToyFlix</a> last month raised $1 million in pre-seed funding, per Crunchbase.</p>\n<p>So if you’re struggling with shopping for kids this holiday season — whether they be your own or someone else’s — hopefully this will give you some creative and fun ideas.</p>\n<h2>Related reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/retail/startup-venture-b2c-healthcare-clothing-electronics/\">What Startups Are Selling For The Person Who Has Everything </a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Illustration: <a href=\"https://www.domguzman.com/\">Dom Guzman</a></em></p>\n<img class=\"ss-hidden-pin-image\" src=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/AI_robotics_Nesting_Doll.jpg\" />",

          "value": "<p>It’s that time of year again, where parents are frantically looking for the new cool thing to wrap up and surprise their kids with this holiday season. The choices are more diverse than ever, especially as artificial intelligence has been increasingly incorporated into children&#8217;s toys.</p>\n<p>What is intriguing, however, is that while AI-enabled toys are gaining traction, we are simultaneously seeing renewed interest in older technologies, including analog toys and screen-free gadgets. There is also a movement toward toys that are more than mere playthings, but also models of cultural learning and identity.</p>\n<p>While Crunchbase data shows the toy industry overall doesn&#8217;t receive much in the way of venture dollars, there are some companies in the space getting investor cash, many with an AI angle. So as we head into the holiday season, we thought it would be fun to see what funded startups in the toy space are selling this year, and some of the trends catching investor attention. (I’m of the age where I mostly got Barbies and Play-Doh, so all of these cool new toys are extra fascinating to me.)</p>\n<h2>AI-enabled</h2>\n<p>It’s no surprise that artificial intelligence has made its way into the toy industry, as it is infiltrating seemingly every industry in one way or another. While there’s still plenty of debate about the potential risks and drawbacks of AI technologies aimed at children, the AI toys market is projected to nearly triple to $6.4 billion by 2032, up from $2.2 billion in 2024, according to a recent <a href=\"https://www.credenceresearch.com/report/smart-ai-toys-market\">report</a> from <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/credence-research\">Credence Research</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the funded startups marketing an AI-enabled toy for youngsters this holiday season is <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bondu\">Bondu</a>. In early October, the company unveiled its AI-powered conversational companion in the form of a stuffed dinosaur. According to <a href=\"https://gamesbeat.com/ai-toy-startup-raises-5-3-million-to-launch-emotionally-intelligent-companion-for-kids-named-bondu/\">GamesBeat</a>, the new toy is designed “to help children learn, imagine, and grow through safe, interactive play.” The startup has raised $5.3 million in a seed funding round led by <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/makers-fund\">Makers Fund</a> with participation from <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/samsung-ventures\">Samsung Ventures</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/boostfunder\">Boost VC</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/founders-c414\">Founders Inc.</a></p>\n<p>Bondu is not cheap. The toy costs $199.99, but hey, at least it comes in four different colors. Ironically, even though the toy is powered by AI, the company is<a href=\"https://sfstandard.com/2025/11/01/ai-toys-talking-stuffed-animals/\"> touting it as a way of helping your kids “say goodbye to screens.”</a></p>\n<p>Some of the things Bondu can do, according to its manufacturer: help kids learn by having “conversations” in which it answers questions and teaches facts and can reply back to a child in 32 languages. Parents can even use the toy to set reminders in an effort to motivate their kids to do boring tasks such as brushing their teeth.</p>\n<p>Another startup funded this year that offers a screenless, conversational, AI-powered toy is <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/roybi\">Roybi</a>, a San Jose, California-based maker of a companion robot for young children. The company, which has raised $4.3 million to date, likewise touts a companion that it says can help young children with language development (English, Spanish, French and Mandarin), and math and science skills.</p>\n<p>The funded companies are examples of growing investor interest in embedding conversational AI into physical toys.</p>\n<p>More recently, another AI-enabled startup, New York-based <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/stickerbox-adec\">Stickerbox</a>, managed to raise $7 million in seed funding in just two months after co-founder <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/robert-whitney-85a2\">Robert Whitney</a>’s 4-year-old son asked: “Can we make our own coloring sheets?”</p>\n<p>That question prompted Whitney, an alumnus of <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/anthropic\">Anthropic</a>, to join co-founder and CEO <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/arun-gupta-a667\">Arun Gupta</a> (formerly of <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/grailed\">Grailed</a>) to start Stickerbox, a toy company that claims it has developed the first-ever voice-powered AI creativity tool for kids.</p>\n<p>Investors such as <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/maveron\">Maveron</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ai2-incubator-dc48\">AI2 Incubator</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/matt-brezina\">Matthew Brezina</a> and tennis legend <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/serena-williams\">Serena Williams</a>’ <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/serena-ventures\">Serena Ventures</a> wrote checks into the startup to help it grow.</p>\n<p>The Stickerbox is <a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/interesting-deals-month-ai-robotic-arms-artificial-retina-healthcare/\">pretty much like what it sounds like</a>: A cube that prints stickers. Children deliver prompts for images with their voices. Importantly, the company says, the box doesn’t collect voice data and doesn’t have a camera.</p>\n<p>Like many other popular techie toys these days, including the <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/yoto\">Yoto</a> and Toniebox audio players, Stickerbox also emphasizes that while it’s tech-enabled, it’s screen free, meaning it doesn’t come with many of the <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10353947/\">drawbacks associated with excess screentime for children’s developing brains.</a></p>\n<h2>What’s old is new again</h2>\n<p>The move away from screens is another trend that’s attracting investor interest.</p>\n<p>Case in point: In September, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/far-homes\">Tin Can</a>, which has created a landline-style WiFi telephone for children, raised $3.5 million in funding. For those of us who remember the days of phones with actual cords, there is something nostalgic about the idea behind <a href=\"https://tincan.kids/\">Tin Can</a>. Essentially, the Seattle-based startup is tapping into a trend where parents want simpler, more “analog” devices for kids so they can slowly back away from the screens and participate in more direct communication.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/psl-ventures\">PSL Ventures</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/newfund-management\">Newfund Capital</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mother-ventures\">Mother Ventures</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/solid-foundations\">Solid Foundations</a> all felt compelled to fund the company.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/greg-gottesman\">Greg Gottesman</a>, managing director at Seattle-based PSL, told <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2025/landline-inspired-phone-startup-raises-3-5m-investor-calls-it-one-of-the-most-viral-businesses-i-have-seen/\">GeekWire</a> that he believes Tin Can is “one of the fastest growing and most viral businesses” he’s seen in over 25 years of investing.</p>\n<p>Personally, I <em>love</em> the idea of these colorful phones that are shaped like, you guessed it, oversized tin cans. Kids can actually talk to each other without a screen or via text. One might argue that kids can talk to each other with cellular phones. But to that, I argue back, cellphones still have screens.</p>\n<p>I’m rooting for this one.</p>\n<h2>Other trends: Subscriptions and cultural ties</h2>\n<p>Two other trends we’ve spotted in our perusal of funded companies in the toy space: Those that tap into cultural heritage, and subscription offerings aimed at reducing clutter.</p>\n<p>In October, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gubbachhi\">Gubbachhi</a>, a toy brand offering handcrafted, eco-friendly toys inspired by Indian culture and heritage, raised an undisclosed amount of funding from <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/d2c-insider-angels\">D2C Insider Angels</a>. The nod to promoting culture is one to be applauded.</p>\n<p>And last but not least: We all know how easily kids can get bored with toys. They’ll play with one toy for two months straight, only to discard it with not so much as a glance at it again.</p>\n<p>A startup called <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/orbit-crates\">Orbit Crates</a> has the solution for frustrated parents who are tired of seeing discarded toys strewn all over the house, cluttering up rooms and taking up space — not to mention the money wasted on toys that are only played with for a short time before their child loses interest and moves on.</p>\n<p>Started by mother of three <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/kim-conti-1b25\">Kim Conti</a>, ​​Orbit Crates is a subscription toy-rental company designed for children aged newborn to 6. The startup, according to <a href=\"https://today.uconn.edu/2025/09/wolff-finalist-startup-orbit-crates-offers-subscription-toy-rentals-for-kids/\">UConn Toda</a>y, “has almost 500 toys in stock, from classic wooden toys to Bluey and <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/the-walt-disney-company\">Disney</a> princesses.” The startup participated in the <a href=\"https://today.uconn.edu/2025/10/wolff-competition-awards-grand-prize-to-company-using-seaweed-to-replace-plastic/\">Wolff New Venture Competition</a> in October, winning the $5,000 Mark and Jamie Summer Innovation Award.</p>\n<p>In India, a similar toy rental startup called <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/toyflix\">ToyFlix</a> last month raised $1 million in pre-seed funding, per Crunchbase.</p>\n<p>So if you’re struggling with shopping for kids this holiday season — whether they be your own or someone else’s — hopefully this will give you some creative and fun ideas.</p>\n<h2>Related reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/retail/startup-venture-b2c-healthcare-clothing-electronics/\">What Startups Are Selling For The Person Who Has Everything </a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Illustration: <a href=\"https://www.domguzman.com/\">Dom Guzman</a></em></p>\n<img class=\"ss-hidden-pin-image\" src=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/AI_robotics_Nesting_Doll.jpg\" />"

During the dot-com boom, 97% of fiber capacity sat unused. In 2025, the opposite is true: Every unit of compute is active, utilization rates remain high, and returns on AI infrastructure are already positive.</p>\n<p>Global investment in generative AI <a href=\"https://www.ey.com/en_ie/newsroom/2025/06/generative-ai-vc-funding-49-2b-h1-2025-ey-report\">reached $49 billion</a> in the first half of the year, driven by hyperscalers reinvesting profits, rather than speculation.</p>\n<p>The first wave of AI value went to the foundation model builders — <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/openai\">OpenAI</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/anthropic\">Anthropic</a> and others — whose breakthroughs triggered an explosion of experimentation at the application layer. That wave proved what was possible.</p>\n<p>Now, as investment scales and adoption spreads into regulated sectors, the challenge has shifted downstream. The frontier is no longer building larger models, but getting AI live — safely, reliably and within real-world constraints. Deployment at this stage depends on more than compute access or APIs; it requires embedded teams who understand the domain, the workflows and the regulations that shape how AI performs. That blend of infrastructure and expertise is becoming the new differentiator — the layer that turns potential into production.</p>\n<p>Physical capacity is tightening. Data centers <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-capital/our-insights/how-data-centers-and-the-energy-sector-can-sate-ais-hunger-for-power\">now consume up to 10 gigawatts per site</a>.</p>\n<p>But the greater bottleneck is operational: compliance frameworks growing more complex, orchestration challenges in global deployment, and the gap between proof-of-concept and production. When AI systems stall in pilots, even the most advanced infrastructure struggles to deliver returns.</p>\n<h2>The deployment gap</h2>\n<p>Across sectors, between <a href=\"https://nanda.media.mit.edu/\">80% and 95% of AI projects fail</a>, not only because of inaccuracies but because compliance and validation are treated as afterthoughts. In healthcare, U.S. hospitals <a href=\"https://www.aha.org/guidesreports/2017-11-03-regulatory-overload-report\">spend an estimated $39 billion annually</a> on compliance and administrative oversight. Similar dynamics exist across financial services, energy and any domain where AI must operate within regulatory boundaries.</p>\n<p>Developers are asking new questions: How can models remain auditable as they evolve? How can performance stay consistent across jurisdictions with different data rules? How can costs be contained as usage grows unpredictably? In healthcare, this means API platforms that handle medical-grade data securely, automate audit trails for regulators, and enable deployment in weeks instead of months. Building that capability from scratch delays product launches and drains engineering resources most teams don&#8217;t have.</p>\n<p>The next decade of value lies in the infrastructure making AI both compliant and scalable — the layer that allows innovation to move from impressive demos to mainstream deployment.</p>\n<h2>The rise of vertical infrastructure</h2>\n<p>The next evolution of infrastructure will be vertical. General-purpose compute makes AI possible, but domain-specific infrastructure makes it usable. The highest stakes industries — healthcare, energy, finance, precision manufacturing — depend on systems that understand their regulations, workflows and risk thresholds. That&#8217;s where the next generation of durable value will form.</p>\n<p>The demand signal is clear. To secure long-term success, developers need to build on AI infrastructure that makes their solutions fully deployable. Accuracy is necessary but not sufficient. Deployment is the bottleneck.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/corti\">Corti</a>’s <a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/feed/#footnote-1-92731\" id=\"note-1-92731\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a> experience illustrates how this is playing out. Health systems need AI they can deploy and trust, not just test. By embedding validation, compliance and audit directly into its APIs, Corti enables developers to integrate clinical-grade AI in weeks rather than months. What began as a healthcare challenge is becoming a broader design pattern — an infrastructure model that abstracts away friction between innovation and safe adoption at scale.</p>\n<h2>Europe&#8217;s structural advantage</h2>\n<p>Europe&#8217;s early emphasis on interoperability, privacy and safety once seemed like a constraint. As the market shifts from experimentation to widespread deployment, those principles have become a competitive advantage.</p>\n<p>This is playing out in real procurement decisions. When a top-three global healthtech provider evaluated infrastructure for their clinical AI deployments, they chose Corti over <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft\">Microsoft</a>, OpenAI and Anthropic. What began as months of technical due diligence became a landmark agreement — a signal that global buyers now prioritize compliance architecture and deployment readiness alongside model capability.</p>\n<p>Companies that embedded regulatory principles from day one are structurally better positioned for this phase. European builders have been designing for this complexity from the start, treating compliance as a core product requirement rather than a go-to-market barrier.</p>\n<p>Every transformative technology becomes more efficient over time, and AI is no exception. Model efficiency improves by an order of magnitude annually, while infrastructure-led automation removes friction across regulated sectors. This is not a bubble deflating; it is a market maturing from frontier research to scaled production.</p>\n<p>The next era belongs to the builders who recognized early that deployment, not just capability, would define who wins. The hype will fade, as it always does. What remains is infrastructure purpose-built for the hardest problems, allowing thousands of companies to turn AI&#8217;s transformational potential into measurable reality.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/laura-connell\">Laura Connell</a> is a senior partner at <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/atomico\">Atomico</a>, the founder-built European venture capital firm.

In 2025, the opposite is true: Every unit of compute is active, utilization rates remain high, and returns on AI infrastructure are already positive.</p>\n<p>Global investment in generative AI <a href=\"https://www.ey.com/en_ie/newsroom/2025/06/generative-ai-vc-funding-49-2b-h1-2025-ey-report\">reached $49 billion</a> in the first half of the year, driven by hyperscalers reinvesting profits, rather than speculation.</p>\n<p>The first wave of AI value went to the foundation model builders — <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/openai\">OpenAI</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/anthropic\">Anthropic</a> and others — whose breakthroughs triggered an explosion of experimentation at the application layer. That wave proved what was possible.</p>\n<p>Now, as investment scales and adoption spreads into regulated sectors, the challenge has shifted downstream. The frontier is no longer building larger models, but getting AI live — safely, reliably and within real-world constraints. Deployment at this stage depends on more than compute access or APIs; it requires embedded teams who understand the domain, the workflows and the regulations that shape how AI performs. That blend of infrastructure and expertise is becoming the new differentiator — the layer that turns potential into production.</p>\n<p>Physical capacity is tightening. Data centers <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-capital/our-insights/how-data-centers-and-the-energy-sector-can-sate-ais-hunger-for-power\">now consume up to 10 gigawatts per site</a>.</p>\n<p>But the greater bottleneck is operational: compliance frameworks growing more complex, orchestration challenges in global deployment, and the gap between proof-of-concept and production. When AI systems stall in pilots, even the most advanced infrastructure struggles to deliver returns.</p>\n<h2>The deployment gap</h2>\n<p>Across sectors, between <a href=\"https://nanda.media.mit.edu/\">80% and 95% of AI projects fail</a>, not only because of inaccuracies but because compliance and validation are treated as afterthoughts. In healthcare, U.S. hospitals <a href=\"https://www.aha.org/guidesreports/2017-11-03-regulatory-overload-report\">spend an estimated $39 billion annually</a> on compliance and administrative oversight. Similar dynamics exist across financial services, energy and any domain where AI must operate within regulatory boundaries.</p>\n<p>Developers are asking new questions: How can models remain auditable as they evolve? How can performance stay consistent across jurisdictions with different data rules? How can costs be contained as usage grows unpredictably? In healthcare, this means API platforms that handle medical-grade data securely, automate audit trails for regulators, and enable deployment in weeks instead of months. Building that capability from scratch delays product launches and drains engineering resources most teams don&#8217;t have.</p>\n<p>The next decade of value lies in the infrastructure making AI both compliant and scalable — the layer that allows innovation to move from impressive demos to mainstream deployment.</p>\n<h2>The rise of vertical infrastructure</h2>\n<p>The next evolution of infrastructure will be vertical. General-purpose compute makes AI possible, but domain-specific infrastructure makes it usable. The highest stakes industries — healthcare, energy, finance, precision manufacturing — depend on systems that understand their regulations, workflows and risk thresholds. That&#8217;s where the next generation of durable value will form.</p>\n<p>The demand signal is clear. To secure long-term success, developers need to build on AI infrastructure that makes their solutions fully deployable. Accuracy is necessary but not sufficient. Deployment is the bottleneck.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/corti\">Corti</a>’s <a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/feed/#footnote-1-92731\" id=\"note-1-92731\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a> experience illustrates how this is playing out. Health systems need AI they can deploy and trust, not just test. By embedding validation, compliance and audit directly into its APIs, Corti enables developers to integrate clinical-grade AI in weeks rather than months. What began as a healthcare challenge is becoming a broader design pattern — an infrastructure model that abstracts away friction between innovation and safe adoption at scale.</p>\n<h2>Europe&#8217;s structural advantage</h2>\n<p>Europe&#8217;s early emphasis on interoperability, privacy and safety once seemed like a constraint. As the market shifts from experimentation to widespread deployment, those principles have become a competitive advantage.</p>\n<p>This is playing out in real procurement decisions. When a top-three global healthtech provider evaluated infrastructure for their clinical AI deployments, they chose Corti over <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft\">Microsoft</a>, OpenAI and Anthropic. What began as months of technical due diligence became a landmark agreement — a signal that global buyers now prioritize compliance architecture and deployment readiness alongside model capability.</p>\n<p>Companies that embedded regulatory principles from day one are structurally better positioned for this phase. European builders have been designing for this complexity from the start, treating compliance as a core product requirement rather than a go-to-market barrier.</p>\n<p>Every transformative technology becomes more efficient over time, and AI is no exception. Model efficiency improves by an order of magnitude annually, while infrastructure-led automation removes friction across regulated sectors. This is not a bubble deflating; it is a market maturing from frontier research to scaled production.</p>\n<p>The next era belongs to the builders who recognized early that deployment, not just capability, would define who wins. The hype will fade, as it always does. What remains is infrastructure purpose-built for the hardest problems, allowing thousands of companies to turn AI&#8217;s transformational potential into measurable reality.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/laura-connell\">Laura Connell</a> is a senior partner at <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/atomico\">Atomico</a>, the founder-built European venture capital firm.

Many see that concentration as a warning sign and indication the market is distorted by hype. But in reality, this wave of AI investment is expanding the opportunity for founders and investors alike to lay the groundwork for new companies and industries to emerge around this transformative technology.</p>\n<p>In the second quarter of 2025 alone, global venture funding <a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/global-funding-climbs-q2-2025-ai-ma-data/\">reached $91 billion</a>, with roughly $40 billion (about 45%) going to AI companies, led by record-setting rounds for <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/openai\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/scale-2\">Scale AI</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/global-funding-climbs-q2-2025-ai-ma-data/\">Sixteen companies</a> captured a third of all global capital that quarter.

These companies will cover everything from model training and inference to data management.</p>\n<p>As that base layer hardens, the wave of applied innovation that follows will be faster and more powerful than anything we’ve seen since the mobile and cloud tech booms.</p>\n<p>We’re already seeing this take shape as entrepreneurs spin out of <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/anthropic\">Anthropic</a>, OpenAI and other leaders to launch startups in areas like legal automation, robotics and drug discovery. Operators who spent the past decade building SaaS or fintech are now reimagining those same sectors through an AI lens.</p>\n<p>Investors who once avoided deep tech are developing new theses around it. The center of gravity may sit with a handful of large AI companies, but the opportunities radiating outward are multiplying across the entire ecosystem.</p>\n<h2>Real companies, real revenue, real ROI</h2>\n<p>Critics argue that too much capital in one sector creates fragility. And yes, valuations are elevated and investors are right to be discerning. But many of these AI-driven companies are already <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd6a895e-d296-4dab-9aab-15a1559ea054\">generating real revenue</a> and delivering measurable ROI to customers.</p>\n<p>Some of the companies in my portfolio are emblematic, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/meetelise\">EliseAI</a> is used by 28 of the top 30 multifamily owners and operators to automate up to 90% of their leasing maintenance and rent collection workflows, leading to reduced labor costs, increased conversion rates on leases, and lower rental delinquencies.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/valence-5e27\">Valence</a> enables enterprises to provide personalized coaching to hundreds of thousands of employees, increasing productivity and retention.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/exodigo\">Exodigo</a> uses multisensor hardware and AI to <a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/startups/interesting-deals-biotech-ai-legal-tech-july-2025/\">map what’s underground before major infrastructure projects break ground</a>. Customers avoid costly utility strikes that cause more than $125 billion in damages each year. These companies are generating measurable and scalable ROI for customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are not the hallmarks of an economic bubble where economic reality is ignored and often fueled by debt, but rather an equity-financed productivity boom with measurable economic impact. While there were booms and busts during the Industrial Revolution, the efficiency of using, say, a cotton gin over human labor isn&#8217;t erased. The compounding effects of this AI revolution on productivity could be orders of magnitude larger.</p>\n<p>That’s why the current moment is not a zero-sum game. For every billion dollars going into a foundational model, thousands of startups are emerging to apply those advances in specific markets. As these applied startups grow, they drive productivity and create new data, infrastructure demand and entirely new categories. The feedback loop between infrastructure and application is what defines every major technology cycle.</p>\n<h2>For long-term investors, tech is your only friend</h2>\n<p>Tech as a percentage of GDP grew from 1%-2% about 50 years ago to 14% today. In 20-30 years, it could very well be 28%-50%. Tech as a percent of the S&amp;P stands at 45%. In the future, that percent could be north of 70%, with much of the bulk of that value being created in the private sector.</p>\n<p>Economists know that two things have driven economic growth over the past 200 years: (first) population growth and (second) new goods and services. With population growth flatlining, investors looking for growth will turn to new goods and services. And the bulk of those new goods and services? Tech.</p>\n<p>Those that opted out of tech as too dangerous 20 years ago were hurt pretty badly. Just look at those that stuck to the European stock indexes. The next 20 years will be even more painful if one doesn&#8217;t have sufficient tech exposure. And private markets are a critical allocation given this new AI-driven productivity revolution.</p>\n<h2>Why this cycle will move faster and reward tech-heavy investors</h2>\n<p>We are also beginning to see why this cycle is so different from the SaaS era. The average SaaS company historically needed<a href=\"https://www.iconiqcapital.com/growth/insights/scaling-from-1-to-20-arr\"> about seven years</a> to reach $20 million in annual revenue.</p>\n<p>Enterprise AI software companies are hitting that milestone in closer to two years. Many top performers are growing well above 200% annually, which is double the pace of last-generation software companies, and getting to profitability substantially faster. As long as AI companies continue driving real, measurable economic impact for their end users, this boom rests on fundamental value, not speculation.</p>\n<p>The real winners of this cycle will be the builders who turn today’s massive infrastructure investments into the next generation of enduring companies. Investors who understand how to participate intelligently will be best positioned for what comes next.</p>\n<p>The venture market isn’t shrinking around a few giants; it’s opening new frontiers at remarkable speed. There are many ways to play this wave as an investor. At <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/alpha-venture-partners\">Alpha Partners</a>, we believe winning in this hyper-growth environment means co-investing in market leaders with strong fundamentals, a clear ROI for customers, a disciplined approach to valuation, and a focus on vertical application-layer businesses. There is substantial opportunity for investors and entrepreneurs that keep their heads down and focus on building great companies that add value to their customers, our economy and society.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/steve-brotman\">Steve Brotman</a> is the founder and managing partner of <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/alpha-venture-partners\">Alpha Partners</a>, a growth-equity firm that co-invests in venture-backed companies by leveraging the unused pro-rata rights of more than 1,000 early-stage VC partners.</em></p>\n<h2>Related reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/ai-openai-coreweave-investor-qa-klein-suro-capital/\">Why This OpenAI And CoreWeave Investor Thinks The AI Market Is ‘Dangerously Overheated’</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/ai-bubble-debate-price-value-risk-gray-equidam/\">The Great ‘AI Bubble’ Debate</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Illustration: <a href=\"https://www.domguzman.com/\">Dom Guzman</a></em></p>\n<img class=\"ss-hidden-pin-image\" src=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/concentrated-capital.jpg\" />",

And private markets are a critical allocation given this new AI-driven productivity revolution.</p>\n<h2>Why this cycle will move faster and reward tech-heavy investors</h2>\n<p>We are also beginning to see why this cycle is so different from the SaaS era. The average SaaS company historically needed<a href=\"https://www.iconiqcapital.com/growth/insights/scaling-from-1-to-20-arr\"> about seven years</a> to reach $20 million in annual revenue.</p>\n<p>Enterprise AI software companies are hitting that milestone in closer to two years. Many top performers are growing well above 200% annually, which is double the pace of last-generation software companies, and getting to profitability substantially faster. As long as AI companies continue driving real, measurable economic impact for their end users, this boom rests on fundamental value, not speculation.</p>\n<p>The real winners of this cycle will be the builders who turn today’s massive infrastructure investments into the next generation of enduring companies. Investors who understand how to participate intelligently will be best positioned for what comes next.</p>\n<p>The venture market isn’t shrinking around a few giants; it’s opening new frontiers at remarkable speed. There are many ways to play this wave as an investor. At <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/alpha-venture-partners\">Alpha Partners</a>, we believe winning in this hyper-growth environment means co-investing in market leaders with strong fundamentals, a clear ROI for customers, a disciplined approach to valuation, and a focus on vertical application-layer businesses. There is substantial opportunity for investors and entrepreneurs that keep their heads down and focus on building great companies that add value to their customers, our economy and society.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/steve-brotman\">Steve Brotman</a> is the founder and managing partner of <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/alpha-venture-partners\">Alpha Partners</a>, a growth-equity firm that co-invests in venture-backed companies by leveraging the unused pro-rata rights of more than 1,000 early-stage VC partners.</em></p>\n<h2>Related reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/ai-openai-coreweave-investor-qa-klein-suro-capital/\">Why This OpenAI And CoreWeave Investor Thinks The AI Market Is ‘Dangerously Overheated’</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/ai-bubble-debate-price-value-risk-gray-equidam/\">The Great ‘AI Bubble’ Debate</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Illustration: <a href=\"https://www.domguzman.com/\">Dom Guzman</a></em></p>\n<img class=\"ss-hidden-pin-image\" src=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/concentrated-capital.jpg\" />"

We identified 71 Australian scaleups that have each raised over $100 million, a number comparable to Japan (86) and South Korea (96).</p>\n<p>This can be explained by the relative isolation of the Australian ecosystem, which has encouraged the creation of national champions in strategic sectors for the continent such as construction, mining and energy — collectively referred to as “infratech.”</p>\n<h2>Infratech: Australia’s house specialty</h2>\n<p>A closer look at the infratech landscape shows steady growth over the past five years, with venture capital investments rising from $100 million in 2020 to nearly $500 million in 2025.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92771 size-full\" height=\"1520\" src=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/13-2.jpg\" width=\"2481\" /></p>\n<p>Among Australian scaleups, about 1 in 10 (107) operate in this vertical, covering the entire value chain: from critical resources (21%) to construction (57%) and energy systems (22%).</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92770 size-full\" height=\"1753\" src=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/12-2.jpg\" width=\"2481\" /></p>\n<h2>Australia’s dominance in mining AI</h2>\n<p>As highlighted in the “<a href=\"https://app.mtbecosystem.com/research/report/2025-open-innovation-future-of-mining?utm_source=crunchbase&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=alberto\">Unlocking the Future of Mining</a>” report developed by Mind the Bridge with support from <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bhp-billiton-petroleum\">BHP</a>, Austmine and <a href=\"https://hubinnovacionminera.pe/en/inicio-english/\">Hub de Innovación Minera del Perú</a>, and based on dozens of interviews with mining industry experts, large infrastructure projects promoted by local and international corporations (including ACCIONA, BHP and <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rio-tinto\">Rio Tinto</a>) are increasingly integrating new technologies such as AI, advanced robotics, computer vision and digital twins.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it doesn&#8217;t come as a surprise that Australia leads globally, accounting for nearly three quarters of all investments in AI for mining, far ahead of China (12%) and the United States (9%).</p>\n<p>Australia’s dominance in mining AI reflects structural strengths that are tough to match.

Leading examples include Rio Tinto, as well as banks like <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/macquarie-group\">Macquarie Group</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/a-n-z\">ANZ</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/national-australia-bank\">National Australia Bank</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/commonwealth-bank-of-australia\">Commonwealth Bank of Australia</a>.</p>\n<h2>Specialization attracts international players, dispersion does not</h2>\n<p>The Australian strong specialization in specific verticals is attracting the interest of global corporates: 26 large international companies have set up innovation outposts Down Under (<a href=\"https://app.mtbecosystem.com/innovation-map?m=-28.80649%2C133.69397%2C4&amp;lv=corporate%3A1%2Cinstitution%3A0%2Cstartup%3A0%2Cinvestor%3A0&amp;_share=true&amp;utm_source=crunchbase&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=alberto\">map available on MTB Ecosystem</a>).</p>\n<p>This sends a powerful message in today’s innovation world, where the concentration of investments in a handful of major ecosystems has effectively reduced the visibility of nearly all others, pushing them toward marginalization and irrelevance.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialization</strong>, whether in technological domains or industrial applications, can help some of these ecosystems stand out and claim their space on the global innovation map.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92769 size-full\" height=\"1686\" src=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/5-6-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2560\" /></p>\n<p>For more insights on startup and scaleup ecosystems, see Mind the Bridge’s reports (<a href=\"https://app.mtbecosystem.com/research/reports?utm_source=crunchbase&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=alberto\">available for free download here</a>).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_91095\" style=\"width: 226px;\"><img alt=\"Alberto Onetti, Mind The Bridge\" class=\"wp-image-91095 size-medium\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/Dip-Eco-scaled-e1748362031850-226x300.jpg\" width=\"226\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-91095\">Alberto Onetti, Mind The Bridge</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/alberto-onetti\">Alberto Onetti</a> is chairman of <a href=\"https://mindthebridge.com/\">Mind the Bridge</a> and a professor at <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/university-of-insubria\">University of Insubria</a>.

Previously, 11-year-old OnlineMedEd had raised at least <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/onlinemeded#financials\">$30 million in venture funding</a>.</p>\n<p>And in the post-secondary education space, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/modern-campus\">Modern Campus</a>, a Toronto-based provider of software tools for colleges to attract and retain students, sold a majority stake to PE firm <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/providence-equity-partners\">Providence Equity Partners</a> in August.</p>\n<h2>The optimist case</h2>\n<p>Looking ahead, the optimist case is that founders, investors and acquirers alike will find plenty of appealing opportunities in ed tech.</p>\n<p>Longtime education startup investor <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/owl-ventures-lp\">Owl Ventures</a> considers the education and training market to be one of the fastest-growing sectors in the global economy. In its 2025 <a href=\"https://owlvc.genially.com/68ff709238977930ea033e73\">report</a>, the firm projects the global education market is on track to surpass $10 trillion by 2030.</p>\n<p>In terms of growth, Owl unsurprisingly points to AI as the largest ed tech driver. In recent years, the report notes, AI in the classroom has moved beyond the experimentation stage and is already proving vital in saving educators hours of work, providing personalized tutoring to students, and helping craft compelling lesson plans.</p>\n<p>Eventually, it’s likely we’ll see the impact of AI innovation in edtech also showing in the form of more funding for startups in the space.</p>\n<h2>Related Crunchbase queries:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/discover/saved/edtech-and-education-related-funding/743a2fc2-6e14-439b-bbd3-53318c030d66\">Edtech And Education-Related Funding, 2025</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/lists/notable-education-related-startups/e99a1d0e-6373-4c2a-b0e5-e4a54558acbe/funding_rounds\">Notable Education-Related Startups Funded In 2025</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Related reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/cursor-financing-ai-coding-automation/\">Cursor’s $2.3B Financing Reminds Us: Coding Automation Is Still Ultra-Hot</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Illustration: <a href=\"https://www.domguzman.com/\">Dom Guzman</a></em></p>\n<img class=\"ss-hidden-pin-image\" src=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/Edtech.jpg\" />"

    "description": "Skeleton Technologies has officially opened its €220 million SuperFactory in Markranstädt, near Leipzig.    The facility is already delivering to Siemens, General Electric, and Hitachi Energy for Euro...",
    "content": "<p>Skeleton Technologies has officially opened its €220 million SuperFactory in Markranstädt, near Leipzig.    The facility is already delivering to Siemens, General Electric, and Hitachi Energy for European electrical grids, and to major US hyperscalers for AI infrastructure. </p>\n<p>I sat down with CEO Taavi Madiberk to learn all about it.</p>\n<p> Skeleton Technologies is a European global leader in high-power, fast-charging energy storage for AI data centres, grid stability, mobility, and defence. It works with some of the largest companies in the world, from AI hyperscalers to industrial and mobility OEMs, and defence prime contractors, with customers that include Hitachi Energy, Siemens, GE, Honda, Skoda Electric, and Danfoss, among others.   </p>\n<p>Its solutions are based on its patented Curved Graphene raw material, protect essential systems from power fluctuations, stabilise mission-critical infrastructure, enhance performance, and enable wider electrification across sectors where power, reliability, and safety matter most. </p>\n<p> And, with a fully European value chain, Skeleton's supercapacitors use no lithium, cobalt, manganese, or other critical raw materials, and are based on the company's patented Curved Graphene material. </p>\n<h2> What Britishvolt and Northvolt got wrong — and Skeleton got right</h2>\n<p>Building full-scale industrial factories is fraught with risk — and Europe's battery sector has learned this the hard way. <a href=\"https://tech.eu/2023/02/27/britishvolt-finds-new-owner-in-australian-firm-recharge-industries-future-of-northumberland-factory-uncertain/\" target=\"_blank\">Britishvolt</a> remains one of the continent's most high-profile gigafactory collapses: the plant was never built, its assets were sold to Recharge Industries (which also failed to advance the project), and the company was declared bankrupt in 2023. </p>\n<p>Last year, <a href=\"https://www.quattroruote.it/news/industria-finanza/2024/01/04/italvolt_procedura_crisi.html\" target=\"_blank\">Italvolt </a>abandoned its plan to build a gigafactory on the former Olivetti site near Turin, entering insolvency soon after. And in March this year, even heavyweight <a href=\"https://tech.eu/2025/03/12/northvolt-files-for-bankruptcy-imploding-europe-s-bid-to-break-away-from-chinese-battery-dominance/\" target=\"_blank\">Northvolt</a> filed for bankruptcy, with production at its Skellefteå facility coming to a halt in June. </p>\n<p>Madiberk offers vital learnings to the sector, declaring, \"We started the company during the nuclear winter of energy and climate financing — back in 2009. That meant we had to grow organically. We always had a lack of capital, so we needed a product that truly differentiated in the market.\"  </p>\n<p>He believes that you cannot solve factory buildouts with money alone. </p>\n<blockquote><p> \"Europe tried that — and failed. Skeleton has been lucky not to be over-capitalised. A lack of resources forces efficiency. If you hire hundreds of people for a factory scale-up, you get too many chefs in the kitchen. That's a killer in manufacturing.\" </p></blockquote>\n<h2>Strategic partnerships</h2>\n<p>The company derisked its factory buildout by partnering with Siemens  </p>\n<p>\"We used their know-how in logistics, digitalisation, and automation,\" explained Madiberk.  The company initially created a digital twin of the factory, ensuring things worked virtually before building.  </p>\n<h2>“You can’t outsource your way to deeptech”:</h2>\n<p>Crucially, Madiberk sees the company's biggest asset as in-house competence — people who have done it before. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\"The common logic is: hire great people and outsource to industry experts. But top management needs to be hands-on — in equipment supply, in process design, in everything. Certain things you cannot buy from consultancies or outsource.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>  Talent has been another decisive factor. Taavi highlights the company's strategic hires: </p>\n<blockquote><p>\"For AI, we brought in an experienced founder who sold his company to Danfoss for hundreds of millions. Now we have a very strong AI team in Finland.\" </p></blockquote>\n<p>Agility has been just as important. When heavy-duty electrification slowed, Skeleton didn't stay attached to outdated plans. \"Companies must look at real challenges,\" he says, and pivot accordingly. Even though Skeleton Technologies was smaller in the past — delivering to BMW vehicles and Volvo robot trucks — its prior experience allowed it to scale.  </p>\n<p>Madiberk recalled being knee-deep in mud on the land slot in 2023: </p>\n<blockquote><p> \"There was nothing. And I told shareholders, \"Do not worry. There will be a plant here with equipment. We will make it happen.\"  </p></blockquote>\n<p>Further, Madiberk also points out that the company's long-standing focus on materials independence has become a competitive advantage.  </p>\n<p>\"I've told customers for 15 years that critical raw materials matter. We use no lithium, cobalt, or manganese — and have a European value chain. People ignored it for years. After COVID and geopolitical shocks, suddenly it matters.\" </p>\n<h2>Inside Skeleton’s rise from niche markets to a critical infrastructure leader</h2>\n<p>Skeleton Technologies also avoided the path many battery companies took: trying to solve everything with money. Instead, Madiberk contends,</p>\n<blockquote><p> \"We avoided the sexiest, shiniest markets. We never went after EV main batteries. We never went after long-duration grid storage. That was a conscious decision. <br /><br />Two years ago, some investors told me: \"Taavi, these are niche markets. Look at the EV market and that demand. Why aren't you chasing it?\" But we stuck to our core.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p> Rather,  the company focuses on two key areas:  </p>\n<h2>\"We keep the lights on in Europe.\"</h2>\n<p>Five months ago, Skeleton had the largest marketing campaign in its history.  </p>\n<p>\"People in Spain and Portugal noticed — it was the blackout. That moment was a wake-up call for Europe,\" shared Madiberk.  </p>\n<p>The 2025 Iberian blackout highlighted the vulnerabilities of interconnected grids, and the European Commission estimates that €584 billion investment will be needed by 2030 to modernise Europe's electricity networks. </p>\n<p>Madiberk compares renewables to driving without a safety belt, contending, \"the blackout happened because of renewable fluctuations — the solution isn't to go back to coal or nuclear. The solution is adding a safety belt. \" </p>\n<p>German transmission system operators now use Skeleton supercapacitors as the last line of defence for 200 MW building blocks for 1.25 seconds of stability to prevent events like the Spain/Portugal blackout.</p>\n<h2>  Skeleton’s AI pivot pays off </h2>\n<p>Further, about 18 months ago, the team realised that heavy-duty electrification would take longer than expected. So in response, the company focused on delivering supercapacitors to US AI data centre infrastructure companies. </p>\n<p> In 2026, US hyperscalers are expected to invest $330 billion in AI infrastructure, while Europe will invest barely $10 billion. European investment must rise significantly but the continent faces two structural challenges. </p>\n<p>First, electricity bills will increase further as energy-hungry AI data centres drive up demand. Second, only a small share of the value of AI data centre infrastructure is manufactured in Europe. </p>\n<p>Madiberk asserts: </p>\n<blockquote><p> \"We did something differently: Skeleton built its own power electronics and software. That allowed us to get into the AI market. <br /><br />And this niche is becoming our biggest market. </p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>We're also fully vertically integrated: our own materials, our own supercapacitors, our own AI and grid product lines.\" </p></blockquote>\n<h2> AI data centres are overbuilt, overheating, and wasting power</h2>\n<p>A typical AI data centre pulls full power for a second and then, during data transfer, drops GPU load almost to zero — a cycle that repeats constantly. These rapid fluctuations, happening 24/7, create enormous stress on the grid as tens or even hundreds of megawatts swing up and down. </p>\n<p>Right now, around 40 per cent of AI energy is simply wasted, burned off to manage those peaks, and grid connections must be built at twice the required size just to cope. The wasted energy also overheats GPUs — and even immersion cooling can't fully remove that heat — cutting into overall performance. In response, Skeleton built its own power electronics and software. </p>\n<p>According to Madiberk, by using Skeleton's solution, you can get up to 40 per cent more computing power. On a $330 billion investment this year, that's $100 billion in value. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\"We keep the lights on — and we keep GPUs cool. That's our dual mission.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2> How Skeleton’s Leipzig plant powers the AI era</h2>\n<p>Specifically, Skeleton's Leipzig factory plant manufactures the company's latest graphene-based supercapacitors, used in GrapheneGPU™, enabling AI data centres to cut total electricity consumption by up to 44 per cent by smoothing power peaks and reducing stress on the electrical grid. </p>\n<p>At the same time, it keeps a core part of the value chain in Europe.  </p>\n<p>By eliminating power peaks and overheating, GrapheneGPU™ unlocks 40 per cent more computing power from the same investment in NVIDIA, AMD, or other GPUs. </p>\n<p>Further, Skeleton is the only fully integrated European company in high-power energy storage, covering the entire value chain from raw materials to cells, modules, systems, and software. </p>\n<p>The company is built on deep tech and holds more than 70 patent families across the value chain.</p>\n<p> Skeleton's inauguration of the Leipzig supercapacitor facility follows the recent opening of its SuperBattery plant in Varkaus, Finland. The Leipzig SuperFactory will create 420 jobs in Saxony and is designed for an annual output of up to 12 million cells.</p>\n<p> Using digitalisation and automation solutions in collaboration with Siemens Digital Industries, the new plant reinforces Europe's advanced industrial base.</p>",

          "value": "<p>Skeleton Technologies has officially opened its €220 million SuperFactory in Markranstädt, near Leipzig.    The facility is already delivering to Siemens, General Electric, and Hitachi Energy for European electrical grids, and to major US hyperscalers for AI infrastructure. </p>\n<p>I sat down with CEO Taavi Madiberk to learn all about it.</p>\n<p> Skeleton Technologies is a European global leader in high-power, fast-charging energy storage for AI data centres, grid stability, mobility, and defence. It works with some of the largest companies in the world, from AI hyperscalers to industrial and mobility OEMs, and defence prime contractors, with customers that include Hitachi Energy, Siemens, GE, Honda, Skoda Electric, and Danfoss, among others.   </p>\n<p>Its solutions are based on its patented Curved Graphene raw material, protect essential systems from power fluctuations, stabilise mission-critical infrastructure, enhance performance, and enable wider electrification across sectors where power, reliability, and safety matter most. </p>\n<p> And, with a fully European value chain, Skeleton's supercapacitors use no lithium, cobalt, manganese, or other critical raw materials, and are based on the company's patented Curved Graphene material. </p>\n<h2> What Britishvolt and Northvolt got wrong — and Skeleton got right</h2>\n<p>Building full-scale industrial factories is fraught with risk — and Europe's battery sector has learned this the hard way. <a href=\"https://tech.eu/2023/02/27/britishvolt-finds-new-owner-in-australian-firm-recharge-industries-future-of-northumberland-factory-uncertain/\" target=\"_blank\">Britishvolt</a> remains one of the continent's most high-profile gigafactory collapses: the plant was never built, its assets were sold to Recharge Industries (which also failed to advance the project), and the company was declared bankrupt in 2023. </p>\n<p>Last year, <a href=\"https://www.quattroruote.it/news/industria-finanza/2024/01/04/italvolt_procedura_crisi.html\" target=\"_blank\">Italvolt </a>abandoned its plan to build a gigafactory on the former Olivetti site near Turin, entering insolvency soon after. And in March this year, even heavyweight <a href=\"https://tech.eu/2025/03/12/northvolt-files-for-bankruptcy-imploding-europe-s-bid-to-break-away-from-chinese-battery-dominance/\" target=\"_blank\">Northvolt</a> filed for bankruptcy, with production at its Skellefteå facility coming to a halt in June. </p>\n<p>Madiberk offers vital learnings to the sector, declaring, \"We started the company during the nuclear winter of energy and climate financing — back in 2009. That meant we had to grow organically. We always had a lack of capital, so we needed a product that truly differentiated in the market.\"  </p>\n<p>He believes that you cannot solve factory buildouts with money alone. </p>\n<blockquote><p> \"Europe tried that — and failed. Skeleton has been lucky not to be over-capitalised. A lack of resources forces efficiency. If you hire hundreds of people for a factory scale-up, you get too many chefs in the kitchen. That's a killer in manufacturing.\" </p></blockquote>\n<h2>Strategic partnerships</h2>\n<p>The company derisked its factory buildout by partnering with Siemens  </p>\n<p>\"We used their know-how in logistics, digitalisation, and automation,\" explained Madiberk.  The company initially created a digital twin of the factory, ensuring things worked virtually before building.  </p>\n<h2>“You can’t outsource your way to deeptech”:</h2>\n<p>Crucially, Madiberk sees the company's biggest asset as in-house competence — people who have done it before. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\"The common logic is: hire great people and outsource to industry experts. But top management needs to be hands-on — in equipment supply, in process design, in everything. Certain things you cannot buy from consultancies or outsource.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>  Talent has been another decisive factor. Taavi highlights the company's strategic hires: </p>\n<blockquote><p>\"For AI, we brought in an experienced founder who sold his company to Danfoss for hundreds of millions. Now we have a very strong AI team in Finland.\" </p></blockquote>\n<p>Agility has been just as important. When heavy-duty electrification slowed, Skeleton didn't stay attached to outdated plans. \"Companies must look at real challenges,\" he says, and pivot accordingly. Even though Skeleton Technologies was smaller in the past — delivering to BMW vehicles and Volvo robot trucks — its prior experience allowed it to scale.  </p>\n<p>Madiberk recalled being knee-deep in mud on the land slot in 2023: </p>\n<blockquote><p> \"There was nothing. And I told shareholders, \"Do not worry. There will be a plant here with equipment. We will make it happen.\"  </p></blockquote>\n<p>Further, Madiberk also points out that the company's long-standing focus on materials independence has become a competitive advantage.  </p>\n<p>\"I've told customers for 15 years that critical raw materials matter. We use no lithium, cobalt, or manganese — and have a European value chain. People ignored it for years. After COVID and geopolitical shocks, suddenly it matters.\" </p>\n<h2>Inside Skeleton’s rise from niche markets to a critical infrastructure leader</h2>\n<p>Skeleton Technologies also avoided the path many battery companies took: trying to solve everything with money. Instead, Madiberk contends,</p>\n<blockquote><p> \"We avoided the sexiest, shiniest markets. We never went after EV main batteries. We never went after long-duration grid storage. That was a conscious decision. <br /><br />Two years ago, some investors told me: \"Taavi, these are niche markets. Look at the EV market and that demand. Why aren't you chasing it?\" But we stuck to our core.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p> Rather,  the company focuses on two key areas:  </p>\n<h2>\"We keep the lights on in Europe.\"</h2>\n<p>Five months ago, Skeleton had the largest marketing campaign in its history.  </p>\n<p>\"People in Spain and Portugal noticed — it was the blackout. That moment was a wake-up call for Europe,\" shared Madiberk.  </p>\n<p>The 2025 Iberian blackout highlighted the vulnerabilities of interconnected grids, and the European Commission estimates that €584 billion investment will be needed by 2030 to modernise Europe's electricity networks. </p>\n<p>Madiberk compares renewables to driving without a safety belt, contending, \"the blackout happened because of renewable fluctuations — the solution isn't to go back to coal or nuclear. The solution is adding a safety belt. \" </p>\n<p>German transmission system operators now use Skeleton supercapacitors as the last line of defence for 200 MW building blocks for 1.25 seconds of stability to prevent events like the Spain/Portugal blackout.</p>\n<h2>  Skeleton’s AI pivot pays off </h2>\n<p>Further, about 18 months ago, the team realised that heavy-duty electrification would take longer than expected. So in response, the company focused on delivering supercapacitors to US AI data centre infrastructure companies. </p>\n<p> In 2026, US hyperscalers are expected to invest $330 billion in AI infrastructure, while Europe will invest barely $10 billion. European investment must rise significantly but the continent faces two structural challenges. </p>\n<p>First, electricity bills will increase further as energy-hungry AI data centres drive up demand. Second, only a small share of the value of AI data centre infrastructure is manufactured in Europe. </p>\n<p>Madiberk asserts: </p>\n<blockquote><p> \"We did something differently: Skeleton built its own power electronics and software. That allowed us to get into the AI market. <br /><br />And this niche is becoming our biggest market. </p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>We're also fully vertically integrated: our own materials, our own supercapacitors, our own AI and grid product lines.\" </p></blockquote>\n<h2> AI data centres are overbuilt, overheating, and wasting power</h2>\n<p>A typical AI data centre pulls full power for a second and then, during data transfer, drops GPU load almost to zero — a cycle that repeats constantly. These rapid fluctuations, happening 24/7, create enormous stress on the grid as tens or even hundreds of megawatts swing up and down. </p>\n<p>Right now, around 40 per cent of AI energy is simply wasted, burned off to manage those peaks, and grid connections must be built at twice the required size just to cope. The wasted energy also overheats GPUs — and even immersion cooling can't fully remove that heat — cutting into overall performance. In response, Skeleton built its own power electronics and software. </p>\n<p>According to Madiberk, by using Skeleton's solution, you can get up to 40 per cent more computing power. On a $330 billion investment this year, that's $100 billion in value. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\"We keep the lights on — and we keep GPUs cool. That's our dual mission.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2> How Skeleton’s Leipzig plant powers the AI era</h2>\n<p>Specifically, Skeleton's Leipzig factory plant manufactures the company's latest graphene-based supercapacitors, used in GrapheneGPU™, enabling AI data centres to cut total electricity consumption by up to 44 per cent by smoothing power peaks and reducing stress on the electrical grid. </p>\n<p>At the same time, it keeps a core part of the value chain in Europe.  </p>\n<p>By eliminating power peaks and overheating, GrapheneGPU™ unlocks 40 per cent more computing power from the same investment in NVIDIA, AMD, or other GPUs. </p>\n<p>Further, Skeleton is the only fully integrated European company in high-power energy storage, covering the entire value chain from raw materials to cells, modules, systems, and software. </p>\n<p>The company is built on deep tech and holds more than 70 patent families across the value chain.</p>\n<p> Skeleton's inauguration of the Leipzig supercapacitor facility follows the recent opening of its SuperBattery plant in Varkaus, Finland. The Leipzig SuperFactory will create 420 jobs in Saxony and is designed for an annual output of up to 12 million cells.</p>\n<p> Using digitalisation and automation solutions in collaboration with Siemens Digital Industries, the new plant reinforces Europe's advanced industrial base.</p>"

    "content": "<p>For decades, silicon has been the backbone of the semiconductor industry. <a href=\"https://diamfab.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Diamfab</a> believes the next era belongs to diamond. I spoke to CEO Gauthier Chicot to find out why and learn what it takes to industrialise an entirely new material platform. </p>\n<p>French company DIAMFAB is a spin-off from the Institut Néel-CNRS. Its technology is based on 30 years of R&amp;D into the growth of high-quality synthetic diamonds for demanding electronic applications. </p>\n<p>It manufactures synthetic-diamonds that act as an alternative to conventional semiconductor materials(like silicon, silicon carbide (SiC), and Gallium nitride (GaN), especially in power electronics, which convert, manage or distribute high electrical power. </p>\n<p>Diamond is no longer a laboratory material. It is becoming an industrial material. Japan’s <a href=\"https://ookuma-dd.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Ookuma Diamond Device</a> has raised more than €30 million, while more established US player <a href=\"https://www.df.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Diamond Foundry</a> is scaling rapidly — this week announcing a €753 million investment from the Spanish government to build a new microchip manufacturing plant. </p>\n<p> For Diamfab, this rising international activity isn’t a threat — it’s validation. </p>\n<h2>“Diamond chose me” </h2>\n<p>Like many deeptech materials innovation spinouts, Diamfab was born in academia. Chicot admits, “I didn’t choose diamond — diamond chose me.  I studied semiconductor materials and started on other semiconductors, but then I got an opportunity to work on diamond during my PhD thesis. That’s when I discovered diamond and all the properties it can offer.”  </p>\n<h2>Electrification demands a new class of power materials </h2>\n<p>Chicot notes that as more systems become electrified—electric vehicles being a prime example—the need to handle large amounts of electrical power efficiently is growing rapidly. Most power-conversion devices today are still made from silicon, a material that reaches its limits when operating at high power. </p>\n<p>According to Chicot, for 20 or 30 years, we’ve been looking for materials to replace silicon. </p>\n<blockquote><p> “We’ve already moved from silicon to silicon carbide — every Tesla Model 3 has SiC converters inside the car. But we still want to improve efficiency and simplify the system.  <br /><br />The most effective material is diamond. It outperforms silicon carbide.” </p></blockquote>\n<p>Smaller, lighter, tougher Diamond can withstand a voltage three times higher than silicon carbide and thirteen times better than silicon. Further, diamond is extremely good at dissipating heat, even better than copper. </p>\n<p> “That means a diamond device can deal with a lot of power and evacuate its own heat efficiently. If a device heats up, its performance drops. So today we use fans and cooling systems, for example, in electric cars. These systems are bulky and complex. Diamond helps avoid that, “ explains Chicot.  </p>\n<p>Finally, diamond also reduces the carbon footprint.  </p>\n<p>Chicot details: </p>\n<blockquote><p>“We need very small amounts of diamond material to fabricate a device. So from fabrication to usage, the footprint is lower.”</p></blockquote>\n<p> In practice, the use of diamond makes semiconductors compact, lightweight, stable at high temperatures, tolerant to high voltage and radiation, and more energy-efficient than silicon. </p>\n<p> It's invaluable for rugged conditions electronics such as EVs, aerospace, power grids, and radiation-hard systems, while there are also opportunities growing in radio frequency, optoelectronics, high-energy detectors, and quantum technologies using diamond’s NV-centre capabilities. </p>\n<h2>Building the pilot line: from prototypes to industrial reality </h2>\n<p>It's still relatively early days for Diamfab when it comes to rollout, with the team providing prototypes to customers and partners. In March 2024, the company <a href=\"https://tech.eu/2024/03/28/diamond-valley-silicon-semiconductors-face-a-run-for-their-money/\" target=\"_blank\">raised</a> €8.7 million.</p>\n<p>The team is building a pilot line, which will enable it to develop and test wafers and devices in conditions that represent industrial reality. “It also shows partners that we are ready for industrialisation,” explains Chichot.</p>\n<p> Further, there are already niche markets using diamond as a conductive electrode for other materials. </p>\n<blockquote><p> “It’s less “sexy \" than full diamond power devices, but it generates revenue and helps us learn how to operate as an industrial company.” </p></blockquote>\n<h2>The art of transforming a conservative industry  </h2>\n<p>Overall, part of the challenge is convincing customers to embrace what is still in many respects, frontier tech. According to Chicot, a lot of industrial players have heard about diamond, but 10 or 20 years ago.  </p>\n<blockquote><p>“Back then, it was the beginning, and we need to update them and show that the technology has dramatically improved.”</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p> “We also need to show them that we are the right partner to work with. The industry is very conservative. We’re 20 people dealing with companies like Schneider Electric. </p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>So we need to balance showing what we can do, convincing end users, and driving the conversation through the value chain. </p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>We need to convince the end users first. We need to show them the added value and the performance gains. Then the end user will convince the semiconductor player to start working on it.”  </p></blockquote>\n<p>Chicot contends that in France and Europe, companies are more conservative, but most industrial players are now convinced that diamond will be the next material for power electronics. But outside Europe, Japanese companies like Toyota have been exploring the potential of diamond.  </p>\n<blockquote><p>“Interest is strong internationally. The question is when. It depends on how many actors—startups and big players—enter the game.”  </p></blockquote>\n<h2>When wafers scale, industry giants will listen </h2>\n<p>Crucially, one of the biggest wins in Diamfab’s work is that it fits into existing supply chains. According to Chicot, while the beginning of the value chain —”substrate and the layer we grow” — is specific to diamond. </p>\n<blockquote><p> “But once you have the substrate plus the active layer, you can process the wafer in standard clean rooms. Metal deposition, lithography, and so on — it’s the same equipment as for other semiconductors. The only requirement is wafer size. Industrial facilities need at least a 4-inch wafer to enter their production line. </p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>But the equipment itself is the same. For example, to fabricate prototypes today, we use research facilities with the same equipment used for gallium nitride and others, just with an adapted recipe.”</p></blockquote>\n<p> When the material is ready in sufficiently large wafers, the team can propose it to STMicroelectronics, TSMC, and so on.  </p>\n<p>“They will need a dedicated line to avoid cross-contamination, but the equipment doesn’t need to be different. The value comes from the diamond material itself,” explained Chicot. ´</p>\n<h2> Why diamond is Europe’s best shot at reindustrialising semiconductors</h2>\n<p> Chicot contends that Diamfab's mission is to demonstrate that diamond has an industrial reality:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“In Europe, we actually have almost everything we need to build a diamond semiconductor supply chain: research centres, substrate providers, device expertise, and major industrial players. </p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>This is an opportunity to reindustrialise semiconductors in Europe. Diamond power electronics is a new technology — and Europe is strong in power electronics. <br /><br />It’s easier to industrialise a new technology than to close the huge gap in silicon manufacturing, where Asia is already mature. We need to take advantage of this new technology to build a new ecosystem in Europe.”<br /><br /></p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Lead image: DIAMFAB wafer diodes. Photo:Grenoble Alpes Metropole.

According to Chicot, while the beginning of the value chain —”substrate and the layer we grow” — is specific to diamond. </p>\n<blockquote><p> “But once you have the substrate plus the active layer, you can process the wafer in standard clean rooms. Metal deposition, lithography, and so on — it’s the same equipment as for other semiconductors. The only requirement is wafer size. Industrial facilities need at least a 4-inch wafer to enter their production line. </p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>But the equipment itself is the same. For example, to fabricate prototypes today, we use research facilities with the same equipment used for gallium nitride and others, just with an adapted recipe.”</p></blockquote>\n<p> When the material is ready in sufficiently large wafers, the team can propose it to STMicroelectronics, TSMC, and so on.  </p>\n<p>“They will need a dedicated line to avoid cross-contamination, but the equipment doesn’t need to be different. The value comes from the diamond material itself,” explained Chicot. ´</p>\n<h2> Why diamond is Europe’s best shot at reindustrialising semiconductors</h2>\n<p> Chicot contends that Diamfab's mission is to demonstrate that diamond has an industrial reality:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“In Europe, we actually have almost everything we need to build a diamond semiconductor supply chain: research centres, substrate providers, device expertise, and major industrial players. </p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>This is an opportunity to reindustrialise semiconductors in Europe. Diamond power electronics is a new technology — and Europe is strong in power electronics. <br /><br />It’s easier to industrialise a new technology than to close the huge gap in silicon manufacturing, where Asia is already mature. We need to take advantage of this new technology to build a new ecosystem in Europe.”<br /><br /></p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Lead image: DIAMFAB wafer diodes. Photo:Grenoble Alpes Metropole.

Despite its scale, the sector has historically\nbeen underserved by tailored AI and automation tools. Tyten seeks to address\nthis gap by redefining how repairs and maintenance are managed at scale.</span></p>\n<p><span>Tyten’s AI-powered platform targets\ntwo core bottlenecks: help desk administration and on-site repair execution.\nFrom the moment an issue is reported through to job closure, the system manages\nrepair requests end-to-end. Its first automation module allocates tasks,\ncontacts subcontractors, processes technician reports, flags missing\ninformation, and initiates follow-ups, reducing repetitive work and saving help\ndesk staff up to two out of five working days each week. </span></p>\n<p><span>In the field, technicians receive\nstep-by-step diagnostic and repair guidance, reducing reliance on manuals or\nvideos mid-job. This structured assistance helps them complete work more\nquickly and accurately, closing orders up to 80 per cent faster and supporting\nimproved performance indicators for service providers and their clients.</span></p>\n<p><span>The company was co-founded by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladimir-pushmin/\" target=\"_blank\">Vladimir Pushmin</a> (CEO), <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeynasonov/\" target=\"_blank\">Sergey Nasonov</a> (CTO), and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-petrides-4bb21271/\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Petrides</a> (CCO), who bring combined\nexperience in energy optimisation, AI, and commercial real estate, along with\nfirst-hand insight into the challenges faced by facilities management teams.\nThis close understanding of the sector’s day-to-day realities underpins Tyten’s\nproduct approach. As Vladimir Pushmin, CEO and Co-founder of Tyten, explains:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span>Facilities management is the\ninvisible backbone of every building – but the technology behind it hasn’t kept\nup and has lacked the innovation needed. We built Tyten to solve that, working\nhand in hand with technicians and help desk teams to understand their real\nchallenges.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span>The new capital will be allocated primarily to\nengineering and product development, representing approximately 70-80 per cent\nof the total funding. Tyten is also expanding its technical team to support\ncontinued product development and meet increasing customer demand.</span></p>",

This structured assistance helps them complete work more\nquickly and accurately, closing orders up to 80 per cent faster and supporting\nimproved performance indicators for service providers and their clients.</span></p>\n<p><span>The company was co-founded by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladimir-pushmin/\" target=\"_blank\">Vladimir Pushmin</a> (CEO), <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeynasonov/\" target=\"_blank\">Sergey Nasonov</a> (CTO), and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-petrides-4bb21271/\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Petrides</a> (CCO), who bring combined\nexperience in energy optimisation, AI, and commercial real estate, along with\nfirst-hand insight into the challenges faced by facilities management teams.\nThis close understanding of the sector’s day-to-day realities underpins Tyten’s\nproduct approach. As Vladimir Pushmin, CEO and Co-founder of Tyten, explains:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span>Facilities management is the\ninvisible backbone of every building – but the technology behind it hasn’t kept\nup and has lacked the innovation needed. We built Tyten to solve that, working\nhand in hand with technicians and help desk teams to understand their real\nchallenges.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span>The new capital will be allocated primarily to\nengineering and product development, representing approximately 70-80 per cent\nof the total funding. Tyten is also expanding its technical team to support\ncontinued product development and meet increasing customer demand.</span></p>"

    "description": "Future Energy Ventures (FEV), a global active venture capital advisor for digital and asset-light energy technologies focused on accelerating the global energy transition, today announced the closing ...",
    "content": "<p><a href=\"https://fev.vc/\" target=\"_blank\">Future Energy Ventures</a> (FEV), a global active venture capital advisor for digital and asset-light energy technologies focused on accelerating the global energy transition, today announced the closing of Future Energy Ventures Fund II with a volume of €205 million, along with a dedicated capital fund for Italy of €30 million. With the milestone, FEV positions itself as the largest European advisor for energy-technology-focused VC investments.</p>\n<p> I spoke to Jan Lozek, Managing Director of Future Energy Ventures, to learn more.</p>\n<h2>A near decade of energy investing </h2>\n<p>FEV's goal  is to support companies that are reshaping the energy landscape through digital solutions, strengthening national energy independence, and creating new economic opportunities.</p>\n<p>Lozek started in energy infrastructure and moved into venture capital in 2016. Lozek recalls that “around that time, the energy transition in Europe was already progressing nicely, and together with RWE we set up our first fund, committing €300 million to early-stage technologies.” </p>\n<blockquote><p>“Our conviction then — and still now — was that the future energy system would be built on massive volumes of renewables, but also on the digital tools required to connect, manage, and orchestrate them.”</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Where buildings, batteries, and mobility become energy assets</h2>\n<p>Since 2016, FEV has made around 50 investments and in 2023 launched its current fund, now closed at €235 million. </p>\n<p>Crucially, the Firm invests at late Seed, Series A and B, usually when startups have €1–2 million in revenue and are ready for the next inflection point. </p>\n<p>It invests in startups with AI-driven, software-based solutions that optimise grid efficiency, enable demand flexibility, and integrate cutting-edge technologies into energy systems. </p>\n<p> Alongside renewables, FEV focused on electrification across buildings, industry, and transport. </p>\n<p> “Coming from the energy sector, we were fascinated by how to connect batteries, buildings, and mobility assets to the grid and how to optimise energy flows across these systems,” explained Lozek. </p>\n<p>Electrification creates a new relationship between the classic energy system and the end-user sectors. Buildings, vehicles, and storage assets become energy resources.  </p>\n<p>“We back technologies that make energy flows more efficient and help connect these assets to the system,” shared Lozek.  </p>\n<p>Further, in buildings, the Firm invests in advanced energy management to optimise heating, cooling, and storage. </p>\n<p>Lozek believes the technology needed to accelerate electrification already exists —”and our role is to back the companies positioned to scale it.” </p>\n<p>He admits that earlier investment in sectors such as home energy management systems didn’t always scale at first.</p>\n<blockquote><p>  “But now, with AI and electrification, the timing is finally right. Many technologies that once lacked market readiness are suddenly critical.\"<br /></p></blockquote>\n<p>The portfolio includes companies such as Chloris, Enspired, <a href=\"https://tech.eu/2025/09/15/feldenergy-raises-eur10m-seed-to-accelerate-agrivoltaics-in-germany/\" target=\"_blank\">Feld Energy</a>, <a href=\"https://tech.eu/2023/07/27/ev-energys-expansion-plans-fueled-by-33-million-series-b-funding/\" target=\"_blank\">EV.energy</a>, Jua, Piclo, Reev and Station A, which are advancing changes in flexibility management, e-mobility, building and industry electrification and AI applications. </p>\n<h2>Cracking the Series A–B bottleneck </h2>\n<p>Crucially, FEV helps Series A and B startups scale their businesses,a stage where many struggle to gain traction.  </p>\n<p>Lozek highlighted the need to identify true inflection points, contending it’s crucial to invest where there’s both an immediate need and long-term scalability.  </p>\n<blockquote><p>“For example, <a href=\"https://tech.eu/2025/10/15/enspired-extends-series-b-to-eur40m-to-accelerate-global-ai-powered-bess-expansion/\" target=\"_blank\">enspired</a>, a company managing and trading battery assets using AI, is solving a real pain point today, but also sits at the convergence of a long-term global growth trend in storage.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>.Further, data centres are booming, and for Lozek the question is “how to connect them without compromising energy availability for homes and industry. Software that improves grid throughput, siting, and connection planning is becoming essential.” </p>\n<p>There are also the industry realities that startups face:</p>\n<p> “Energy companies often build for 40 years, so they’re cautious. Procurement cycles can be long, and changing legacy mindsets is tough. Our team’s sector experience helps founders navigate this,” shared Lozek.  </p>\n<p>He also believes that compared to the US, Europe has fewer strong exit routes.  “When you’re aiming for a five- to six-year holding period, that’s a challenge.” </p>\n<p>The good news: European countries are now gradually adjusting pension fund rules to allocate more capital to venture — an important structural shift.</p>\n<h2> Geopolitics is rewriting the energy playbook </h2>\n<p>The vision backed by FEV goes far beyond cleaner electricity. It imagines a transformed global economy in which universal access to locally generated renewable energy reduces dependence on volatile imports and gives nations real sovereignty over their economic future. </p>\n<p>At a time when environmental policies are under pressure and geopolitical tensions highlight the urgency of energy independence, this Fund close signals a fundamental shift toward energy security, economic resilience, and long-term sustainability. The transition from volatile fossil fuel dependency to locally controlled renewable systems is today both an economic necessity and a strategic imperative. <br /></p>\n<p>According to Lozek, geopolitics has made energy independence a top priority.  <br /></p>\n<blockquote><p>“Reducing reliance on imported gas and oil has accelerated interest in renewables and technologies that help manage the system more efficiently. In Europe, and particularly in Germany, investments that strengthen independence from external energy sources make more sense than ever.” <br /></p></blockquote>\n<p>The Fund was initially supported by E.ON SE and the European Investment Fund (EIF) as anchor investors. It now also includes additional strategic and institutional investors such as KFW Capital, ABN AMRO, CLP, BGK, ISA Energia, Borusan, Zorlu Holding, Telos Impact, KELAG, MTR, and Sabanci Climate Ventures.</p>\n<h2>Italy’s startup renaissance draws FEV in</h2>\n<p>The Italian fund is fully financed by CDP and invests alongside the main fund.   FEV’s decision to launch a dedicated <a href=\"https://tech.eu/2025/10/13/autumn-and-arduino-bring-out-the-best-of-italy/\" target=\"_blank\">Italian</a>  vehicle was the result of three converging factors: deep team roots in the country, a rapidly maturing innovation landscape, and investor demand. </p>\n<p>One of the Firm’s partners, Jan Lesinski, grew up in Italy and maintains strong ties to its startup ecosystem.  At the same time, Italy has undergone a notable shift since 2016, with government initiatives and development banks helping to build a more vibrant environment for founders and even drawing talent back from abroad. The structure of the Fund also played a role. </p>\n<p> “CDP wanted to support and back our fund, but they needed to focus their capital on Italy,” Lozek explains. </p>\n<blockquote><p>“That led us to set up two vehicles with the same strategy — one dedicated to the Italian market and the other operating more broadly.” </p></blockquote>\n<h2>Energy as a new top-tier asset class </h2>\n<p>Energy has emerged as the most compelling investment sector of our generation: security requirements, economic growth, employment effects, and cost-effective renewable energy converge into an area where clean energy technology is both indispensable for stability and an exceptional investment opportunity. </p>\n<p>This momentum creates ideal conditions for groundbreaking energy innovations that will complete the transition to a renewable energy world. FEV is therefore well-positioned to identify and scale the technologies that will define the energy systems of the future.</p>\n<p> \"Europe has the innovation power, talent, and industrial capacity to take a leading role in the global energy transition,\" says Veronique Hördemann, Managing Partner and CFO of Future Energy Ventures.  </p>\n<blockquote><p>\"The key now is that political frameworks facilitate investment and scaling, so Europe can fully realise its potential in energy technology. <br /><br />The energy transition offers the opportunity to drive economic growth, strengthen energy sovereignty, secure jobs, and enhance competitiveness.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>An open door for energy innovators </h2>\n<p>For startups or scale-ups interested in potential investment, Lozek urges. </p>\n<blockquote><p> “Just reach out. If you’re building digital or software-driven technology that can make a real difference in the energy transition, we’re happy to talk.  <br /><br />We respond quickly — either with interest or suggestions for other investors with a better fit. We see a lot, and we’re always open to connecting founders with the right people.” <br /></p></blockquote>",

          "value": "<p><a href=\"https://fev.vc/\" target=\"_blank\">Future Energy Ventures</a> (FEV), a global active venture capital advisor for digital and asset-light energy technologies focused on accelerating the global energy transition, today announced the closing of Future Energy Ventures Fund II with a volume of €205 million, along with a dedicated capital fund for Italy of €30 million. With the milestone, FEV positions itself as the largest European advisor for energy-technology-focused VC investments.</p>\n<p> I spoke to Jan Lozek, Managing Director of Future Energy Ventures, to learn more.</p>\n<h2>A near decade of energy investing </h2>\n<p>FEV's goal  is to support companies that are reshaping the energy landscape through digital solutions, strengthening national energy independence, and creating new economic opportunities.</p>\n<p>Lozek started in energy infrastructure and moved into venture capital in 2016. Lozek recalls that “around that time, the energy transition in Europe was already progressing nicely, and together with RWE we set up our first fund, committing €300 million to early-stage technologies.” </p>\n<blockquote><p>“Our conviction then — and still now — was that the future energy system would be built on massive volumes of renewables, but also on the digital tools required to connect, manage, and orchestrate them.”</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Where buildings, batteries, and mobility become energy assets</h2>\n<p>Since 2016, FEV has made around 50 investments and in 2023 launched its current fund, now closed at €235 million. </p>\n<p>Crucially, the Firm invests at late Seed, Series A and B, usually when startups have €1–2 million in revenue and are ready for the next inflection point. </p>\n<p>It invests in startups with AI-driven, software-based solutions that optimise grid efficiency, enable demand flexibility, and integrate cutting-edge technologies into energy systems. </p>\n<p> Alongside renewables, FEV focused on electrification across buildings, industry, and transport. </p>\n<p> “Coming from the energy sector, we were fascinated by how to connect batteries, buildings, and mobility assets to the grid and how to optimise energy flows across these systems,” explained Lozek. </p>\n<p>Electrification creates a new relationship between the classic energy system and the end-user sectors. Buildings, vehicles, and storage assets become energy resources.  </p>\n<p>“We back technologies that make energy flows more efficient and help connect these assets to the system,” shared Lozek.  </p>\n<p>Further, in buildings, the Firm invests in advanced energy management to optimise heating, cooling, and storage. </p>\n<p>Lozek believes the technology needed to accelerate electrification already exists —”and our role is to back the companies positioned to scale it.” </p>\n<p>He admits that earlier investment in sectors such as home energy management systems didn’t always scale at first.</p>\n<blockquote><p>  “But now, with AI and electrification, the timing is finally right. Many technologies that once lacked market readiness are suddenly critical.\"<br /></p></blockquote>\n<p>The portfolio includes companies such as Chloris, Enspired, <a href=\"https://tech.eu/2025/09/15/feldenergy-raises-eur10m-seed-to-accelerate-agrivoltaics-in-germany/\" target=\"_blank\">Feld Energy</a>, <a href=\"https://tech.eu/2023/07/27/ev-energys-expansion-plans-fueled-by-33-million-series-b-funding/\" target=\"_blank\">EV.energy</a>, Jua, Piclo, Reev and Station A, which are advancing changes in flexibility management, e-mobility, building and industry electrification and AI applications. </p>\n<h2>Cracking the Series A–B bottleneck </h2>\n<p>Crucially, FEV helps Series A and B startups scale their businesses,a stage where many struggle to gain traction.  </p>\n<p>Lozek highlighted the need to identify true inflection points, contending it’s crucial to invest where there’s both an immediate need and long-term scalability.  </p>\n<blockquote><p>“For example, <a href=\"https://tech.eu/2025/10/15/enspired-extends-series-b-to-eur40m-to-accelerate-global-ai-powered-bess-expansion/\" target=\"_blank\">enspired</a>, a company managing and trading battery assets using AI, is solving a real pain point today, but also sits at the convergence of a long-term global growth trend in storage.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>.Further, data centres are booming, and for Lozek the question is “how to connect them without compromising energy availability for homes and industry. Software that improves grid throughput, siting, and connection planning is becoming essential.” </p>\n<p>There are also the industry realities that startups face:</p>\n<p> “Energy companies often build for 40 years, so they’re cautious. Procurement cycles can be long, and changing legacy mindsets is tough. Our team’s sector experience helps founders navigate this,” shared Lozek.  </p>\n<p>He also believes that compared to the US, Europe has fewer strong exit routes.  “When you’re aiming for a five- to six-year holding period, that’s a challenge.” </p>\n<p>The good news: European countries are now gradually adjusting pension fund rules to allocate more capital to venture — an important structural shift.</p>\n<h2> Geopolitics is rewriting the energy playbook </h2>\n<p>The vision backed by FEV goes far beyond cleaner electricity. It imagines a transformed global economy in which universal access to locally generated renewable energy reduces dependence on volatile imports and gives nations real sovereignty over their economic future. </p>\n<p>At a time when environmental policies are under pressure and geopolitical tensions highlight the urgency of energy independence, this Fund close signals a fundamental shift toward energy security, economic resilience, and long-term sustainability. The transition from volatile fossil fuel dependency to locally controlled renewable systems is today both an economic necessity and a strategic imperative. <br /></p>\n<p>According to Lozek, geopolitics has made energy independence a top priority.  <br /></p>\n<blockquote><p>“Reducing reliance on imported gas and oil has accelerated interest in renewables and technologies that help manage the system more efficiently. In Europe, and particularly in Germany, investments that strengthen independence from external energy sources make more sense than ever.” <br /></p></blockquote>\n<p>The Fund was initially supported by E.ON SE and the European Investment Fund (EIF) as anchor investors. It now also includes additional strategic and institutional investors such as KFW Capital, ABN AMRO, CLP, BGK, ISA Energia, Borusan, Zorlu Holding, Telos Impact, KELAG, MTR, and Sabanci Climate Ventures.</p>\n<h2>Italy’s startup renaissance draws FEV in</h2>\n<p>The Italian fund is fully financed by CDP and invests alongside the main fund.   FEV’s decision to launch a dedicated <a href=\"https://tech.eu/2025/10/13/autumn-and-arduino-bring-out-the-best-of-italy/\" target=\"_blank\">Italian</a>  vehicle was the result of three converging factors: deep team roots in the country, a rapidly maturing innovation landscape, and investor demand. </p>\n<p>One of the Firm’s partners, Jan Lesinski, grew up in Italy and maintains strong ties to its startup ecosystem.  At the same time, Italy has undergone a notable shift since 2016, with government initiatives and development banks helping to build a more vibrant environment for founders and even drawing talent back from abroad. The structure of the Fund also played a role. </p>\n<p> “CDP wanted to support and back our fund, but they needed to focus their capital on Italy,” Lozek explains. </p>\n<blockquote><p>“That led us to set up two vehicles with the same strategy — one dedicated to the Italian market and the other operating more broadly.” </p></blockquote>\n<h2>Energy as a new top-tier asset class </h2>\n<p>Energy has emerged as the most compelling investment sector of our generation: security requirements, economic growth, employment effects, and cost-effective renewable energy converge into an area where clean energy technology is both indispensable for stability and an exceptional investment opportunity. </p>\n<p>This momentum creates ideal conditions for groundbreaking energy innovations that will complete the transition to a renewable energy world. FEV is therefore well-positioned to identify and scale the technologies that will define the energy systems of the future.</p>\n<p> \"Europe has the innovation power, talent, and industrial capacity to take a leading role in the global energy transition,\" says Veronique Hördemann, Managing Partner and CFO of Future Energy Ventures.  </p>\n<blockquote><p>\"The key now is that political frameworks facilitate investment and scaling, so Europe can fully realise its potential in energy technology. <br /><br />The energy transition offers the opportunity to drive economic growth, strengthen energy sovereignty, secure jobs, and enhance competitiveness.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>An open door for energy innovators </h2>\n<p>For startups or scale-ups interested in potential investment, Lozek urges. </p>\n<blockquote><p> “Just reach out. If you’re building digital or software-driven technology that can make a real difference in the energy transition, we’re happy to talk.  <br /><br />We respond quickly — either with interest or suggestions for other investors with a better fit. We see a lot, and we’re always open to connecting founders with the right people.” <br /></p></blockquote>"

The round was led by <a href=\"https://voimaventures.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Voima Ventures</a>,\nwith participation from COR Group, the Aho family, and both existing and new\ninvestors, including Reaktor and a group of notable angel investors. This\nfollows a €1.7 million pre-seed round in 2024 and brings the company’s total\nfunding to nearly €10 million.</span></p>\n<p><span>Cancer care is becoming increasingly\ncomplex. According to recent studies, by 2050, more than 35 million new cancer\ncases are projected across over 100 cancer types. At the same time, clinicians\nspend several hours per day on administrative tasks in fragmented systems with\nlargely unstructured clinical data, and multidisciplinary teams must make\nrapid, high-stakes decisions across a growing range of personalized treatment\noptions.</span></p>\n<p><span>Gosta Labs addresses these challenges\nwith an oncology-focused AI operating system that converts each patient visit\ninto high-quality structured data in real time. The system summarises and\nvisualises patient journeys, automates clinical documentation, and captures\nstructured clinical data relevant to patient care. </span></p>\n<p><span>It also supports quality of\ncare by assessing key clinical parameters for each treatment pathway and\nautomatically linking decisions to international guidelines. This helps\noncologists deliver faster and more consistent care.</span></p>\n<p><span>The first real-world results from the\nGosta AI Operating System were presented at the ESMO 2025 Congress. The\nfindings indicate that the system generates high-quality consultation notes in\nreal time, structured according to institutional standards. It also\nautomatically classifies Performance Status and CTCAE toxicity grades.\nOncologists were able to complete follow-up visit documentation in a median\ntime of under two minutes, reducing documentation workload and allowing more\ntime for direct patient care.</span></p>\n<p><span>Founded in 2023 by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauri-sippola-8a281152/\" target=\"_blank\">Lauri Sippola</a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/henri-viertolahti-0a9b4352/\" target=\"_blank\">Henri Viertolahti</a>, the founders of Kaiku Health (acquired by Elekta in 2020),\nGosta Labs builds on a track record of developing and scaling regulated digital\nhealth solutions globally. The team combines AI specialists with experienced\noncology and medtech leaders, including Chief Medical Officer Dr Lionel\nHadjadjeba and Chief Operating Officer Reetta Arokoski, both of whom have\nextensive experience in scaling cancer care technologies internationally.</span></p>\n<p><span>The new funding will be used to expand the reach of\nits AI assistant to oncology teams globally and to further strengthen Gosta\nLabs’ medical-device-grade product and AI foundation, enabling safer, more\npersonalised patient encounters with reduced administrative burden.</span></p>"

    "content": "<p>UK startups have broadly welcomed measures introduced by the UK chancellor in the Autumn budget, designed to get entrepreneurs to scale their startups in the UK, which has been a long-running concern for the industry.<br /><br />However, the response from the fintech industry was mixed, with some praising the budget while others bemoaning that more was not offered to support UK fintech as it looks to retain its leadership position.<br /><br />In a budget, which saw the chancellor raise taxes by £26bn, chancellor Rachel Reeves said: “We are sending a simple message to the world, if you build here, Britain will back you.”<br /><br />Unveiling measures to support startup businesses in the UK, the chancellor added: “Growth begins with the spark of an entrepreneur. Half of new jobs in Britain are created by scaleup businesses and we want those jobs created here, not somewhere else. <br /><br />“Our job is to make Britain the best place in the world to startup, to scaleup and to stay.”<br /><br />Measures announced in the budget designed to support entrepreneurs scaling up businesses in the UK include broadening the eligibility requirements for the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) and Venture Capital Trust (VCT) schemes.<br /><br />UK businesses will also get a three-year exemption from stamp duty tax if they choose to IPO in Britain, while the chancellor also launched a “call for evidence” on how the tax system can better back entrepreneurs, with founders and investors at the heart of the review.<br /><br />An uplift in the Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) limits, which enables employees to share in the equity value they create, was also announced.<br /><br /><strong>Industry reaction </strong></p>\n<p>Dom Hallas, executive director, Startup Coalition, said: “In a tricky budget the chancellor made one thing clear - entrepreneurs and founders building high-growth businesses are the engine of growth in the UK. Is this everything that founders could ever need? </p>\n<p>\"No. But does this Budget show that the Government has seriously listened to founders and tried to make things better to build and scale a startup in the UK? Emphatically yes. </p>\n<p>\"Big progress on expanding share options, doubling the scale of EIS and VCTs to back scaleups, and looking again at how entrepreneurs are incentivised in our tax system will make a material difference to founders building today and in the future.”</p>\n<p>Alessandro Maiano, co-founder and CEO, Wilbe, said: “This budget makes clear just how much responsibility taxpayers continue to carry in funding the riskiest stages of scientific discovery. </p>\n<p>“If the UK wants to become a true science superpower, public investment must be complemented by far greater incentives for private individuals, philanthropists and foundations to support early scientific discovery. Without that shift, taxpayers will continue to take the risk without ever sharing in the reward.”</p>\n<p>Cat Mora, director of research operations, Phasecraft, said: “We welcome the UK Government’s commitment to targeted investment in innovation and the message that if you build here, Britain will back you. </p>\n<p>\"Widening eligibility for enterprise incentives and expanding EIS schemes will go some way towards helping this. To stay ahead, the UK must back the quantum companies bringing real use cases to today’s limited hardware, not just preparing for the machines of the future.\"</p>\n<p>Sasha Haco, co-founder and CEO, Unitary, said: “If we want AI to genuinely raise productivity, the government must go beyond investment and needs to become an enthusiastic customer for startups.</p>\n<p>“As well as capital, founders need customers willing to adopt, test and scale innovative products. By using its own buying power, alongside targeted R&amp;D programmes, the government can set the pace for the wider economy. That’s the clearest way to ensure the UK remains a global home for ambitious, high-growth companies.”</p>\n<p>Leo Labeis, founder and CEO, REGnosys, said: “Greater clarity on capital gains treatment, entrepreneur relief, and modernised EIS/EMI rules is exactly what founders have been calling for. This is a strong signal that the Government recognises how vital fiscal stability is for scaling high-growth sectors like RegTech. </p>\n<p>“This makes the UK an even more attractive place to build and scale financial innovation and reinforces London’s position as the natural home for RegTech globally.\"</p>\n<p>Mike Walters, CEO, Form3, said: \"The proposed support for expanding EMI and ensuring that the tax system champions the successes of UK business, founders, and employees is hugely promising. </p>\n<p>\"Preserving the UK’s status as a global hub for fintech will depend on the government protecting and retaining the deep pools of talent that this industry relies on.“It’s disappointing that there was no mention of any plans to back the progress made by the National Payments Vision. </p>\n<p>\"The UK is currently a global payments leader, and building out resilience in banking and payments will set the stage for the next decade of growth.</p>\n<p>“The government needs to build on its Mansion House pledges and ensure a steady stream of capital continues to flow into high-potential companies where it can directly translate into jobs and economic growth.\"</p>\n<p>Janine Hirt, CEO of Innovate Finance, the industry body for UK finfech, said: \"Today’s budget was always going to be a difficult balancing act to manage public finances while driving growth. </p>\n<p>\"The UK fintech community was pleased to see the chancellor acknowledge very early on in her budget speech the importance of supporting entrepreneurs and founders, recognising they are key drivers of growth across our country.<br /></p>\n<p>\"We welcome her announcement of a call for evidence which will seek views on the effectiveness of existing tax incentives, and the wider tax system, for business founders and scaling firms, and how the UK can better support these companies to start, grow and stay in the UK. </p>\n<p>\"This will go a long way in ensuring the UK cements its place as the best place in the world to build and scale a fintech business.\"</p>\n<p>Image: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/tr/photos/madeni-paralar-para-birimi-yat%c4%b1r%c4%b1m-1523383/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></p>",

          "value": "<p>UK startups have broadly welcomed measures introduced by the UK chancellor in the Autumn budget, designed to get entrepreneurs to scale their startups in the UK, which has been a long-running concern for the industry.<br /><br />However, the response from the fintech industry was mixed, with some praising the budget while others bemoaning that more was not offered to support UK fintech as it looks to retain its leadership position.<br /><br />In a budget, which saw the chancellor raise taxes by £26bn, chancellor Rachel Reeves said: “We are sending a simple message to the world, if you build here, Britain will back you.”<br /><br />Unveiling measures to support startup businesses in the UK, the chancellor added: “Growth begins with the spark of an entrepreneur. Half of new jobs in Britain are created by scaleup businesses and we want those jobs created here, not somewhere else. <br /><br />“Our job is to make Britain the best place in the world to startup, to scaleup and to stay.”<br /><br />Measures announced in the budget designed to support entrepreneurs scaling up businesses in the UK include broadening the eligibility requirements for the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) and Venture Capital Trust (VCT) schemes.<br /><br />UK businesses will also get a three-year exemption from stamp duty tax if they choose to IPO in Britain, while the chancellor also launched a “call for evidence” on how the tax system can better back entrepreneurs, with founders and investors at the heart of the review.<br /><br />An uplift in the Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) limits, which enables employees to share in the equity value they create, was also announced.<br /><br /><strong>Industry reaction </strong></p>\n<p>Dom Hallas, executive director, Startup Coalition, said: “In a tricky budget the chancellor made one thing clear - entrepreneurs and founders building high-growth businesses are the engine of growth in the UK. Is this everything that founders could ever need? </p>\n<p>\"No. But does this Budget show that the Government has seriously listened to founders and tried to make things better to build and scale a startup in the UK? Emphatically yes. </p>\n<p>\"Big progress on expanding share options, doubling the scale of EIS and VCTs to back scaleups, and looking again at how entrepreneurs are incentivised in our tax system will make a material difference to founders building today and in the future.”</p>\n<p>Alessandro Maiano, co-founder and CEO, Wilbe, said: “This budget makes clear just how much responsibility taxpayers continue to carry in funding the riskiest stages of scientific discovery. </p>\n<p>“If the UK wants to become a true science superpower, public investment must be complemented by far greater incentives for private individuals, philanthropists and foundations to support early scientific discovery. Without that shift, taxpayers will continue to take the risk without ever sharing in the reward.”</p>\n<p>Cat Mora, director of research operations, Phasecraft, said: “We welcome the UK Government’s commitment to targeted investment in innovation and the message that if you build here, Britain will back you. </p>\n<p>\"Widening eligibility for enterprise incentives and expanding EIS schemes will go some way towards helping this. To stay ahead, the UK must back the quantum companies bringing real use cases to today’s limited hardware, not just preparing for the machines of the future.\"</p>\n<p>Sasha Haco, co-founder and CEO, Unitary, said: “If we want AI to genuinely raise productivity, the government must go beyond investment and needs to become an enthusiastic customer for startups.</p>\n<p>“As well as capital, founders need customers willing to adopt, test and scale innovative products. By using its own buying power, alongside targeted R&amp;D programmes, the government can set the pace for the wider economy. That’s the clearest way to ensure the UK remains a global home for ambitious, high-growth companies.”</p>\n<p>Leo Labeis, founder and CEO, REGnosys, said: “Greater clarity on capital gains treatment, entrepreneur relief, and modernised EIS/EMI rules is exactly what founders have been calling for. This is a strong signal that the Government recognises how vital fiscal stability is for scaling high-growth sectors like RegTech. </p>\n<p>“This makes the UK an even more attractive place to build and scale financial innovation and reinforces London’s position as the natural home for RegTech globally.\"</p>\n<p>Mike Walters, CEO, Form3, said: \"The proposed support for expanding EMI and ensuring that the tax system champions the successes of UK business, founders, and employees is hugely promising. </p>\n<p>\"Preserving the UK’s status as a global hub for fintech will depend on the government protecting and retaining the deep pools of talent that this industry relies on.“It’s disappointing that there was no mention of any plans to back the progress made by the National Payments Vision. </p>\n<p>\"The UK is currently a global payments leader, and building out resilience in banking and payments will set the stage for the next decade of growth.</p>\n<p>“The government needs to build on its Mansion House pledges and ensure a steady stream of capital continues to flow into high-potential companies where it can directly translate into jobs and economic growth.\"</p>\n<p>Janine Hirt, CEO of Innovate Finance, the industry body for UK finfech, said: \"Today’s budget was always going to be a difficult balancing act to manage public finances while driving growth. </p>\n<p>\"The UK fintech community was pleased to see the chancellor acknowledge very early on in her budget speech the importance of supporting entrepreneurs and founders, recognising they are key drivers of growth across our country.<br /></p>\n<p>\"We welcome her announcement of a call for evidence which will seek views on the effectiveness of existing tax incentives, and the wider tax system, for business founders and scaling firms, and how the UK can better support these companies to start, grow and stay in the UK. </p>\n<p>\"This will go a long way in ensuring the UK cements its place as the best place in the world to build and scale a fintech business.\"</p>\n<p>Image: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/tr/photos/madeni-paralar-para-birimi-yat%c4%b1r%c4%b1m-1523383/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></p>"

    "content": "<p>French Entrepreneur Samuel Tual has today launched <a href=\"https://cloverfund.vc/\">Clover</a>, a €30 million early-stage evergreen fund to back startups reshaping the future of work and education. Tual is an entrepreneur, Vice-President of the MEDEF and Chairman & CEO of Actual Group, a major player in employment and labour in France and Europe.</p>\n<p> Clover aims to become the “VC for Work”, an indispensable reference in support of work and education, acting both as an investment fund and as a structuring actor of the ecosystem. </p>\n<p>Designed and structured like a startup, Clover positions itself as agile, fast and scalable, with a simple ambition: to become the go-to platform offering far more than capital to entrepreneurs. </p>\n<p>Clover plans to deploy €100,000 to €200,000 checks in 20 to 30 investments per year at Pre-Seed and Seed stages, with the ambition of becoming the leading investor in the work & education verticals.  </p>\n<p>The fund supports top founders across Europe and the United States, where it is already firmly established with strong ties to the entrepreneurial ecosystem. </p>\n<p>Since May of this year, Clover has already invested approximately €1 million, one-third of which has been committed in the US, in areas such as AI, productivity tools, workflow automation, and workplace health.</p>\n<p> The investment thesis of Clover rests on two core pillars: becoming the reference “VC for Work” and rethinking the traditional venture-capital model together with founders. On one side, the world of work is undergoing a radical transformation driven by AI, new modes of collaboration, increasing demands for productivity, flexibility, inclusivity and sustainability. In France, the national AI initiative aims for 100 per cent of large corporations to adopt artificial intelligence by 2030, while global potential productivity gains via AI are estimated at US $4,400 billion over the long term. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, as France itself faces economic and political uncertainty, marked by budgetary tensions and a tighter investment climate, many hesitate to invest or innovate. </p>\n<p>“I believe in the future of work globally, and I believe that it is precisely in times of uncertainty that one must be daring and innovative. It is imperative to accelerate so we do not fall behind and to safeguard the longevity of our businesses. If the environment is fragile, the future of work is being written now, invented globally, and the rest of the world doesn’t wait”, declares Samuel Tual. <br /> </p>\n<p>Hugo Mendes, Managing Partner, former entrepreneur and investor with Origins, will lead the fund’s construction and management. </p>\n<blockquote><p>“Investing is like recruiting: you must recognise talent before everyone else does. With Clover, our goal is to be a true partner beyond the check, because founders don’t just look for capital, they look for teammates who care, who respond quickly, and who show up again and again.<br /><br /> I’m proud to lead this initiative alongside the Tual family, with whom I share strong entrepreneurial values.” <br /></p></blockquote>\n<p>Lead image: Samuel Tual and Hugo Mendes.

It followed formal complaints filed in March 2025 by CensHERship and The Case For Her under the EU Digital Services Act (DSA). These complaints, submitted on behalf of six women’s health companies, documented biased moderation, lack of transparency, and failures to provide effective appeal mechanisms. Despite clear evidence and growing public concern, no meaningful response or action has been taken to date. <br /></p>\n<p>Key terms describing anatomy, menstrual health, menopause, and postpartum care are flagged as “adult content” or “unprofessional,” while equivalent male health language remains visible.  </p>\n<p>Further, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x07c50sE6KaT_jpLwE94k3hRg27Dm-65/view\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> by <a href=\"https://casanegra.studio/\" target=\"_blank\">CASANEGRA Studio</a> shows this goes beyond erasure, revealing how algorithmic content moderation distorts language and stifles vital health conversations.  </p>\n<p>Their analysis reveals an euphemism economy flourishing across social platforms, where medically precise terms like vulva, uterus, and period mutate into code words or symbols to evade banishment: “down there”, “seggs” or “that time of the month”.  As a result,  clinical language is now treated with the same severity as pornography, pushing women toward euphemisms like *“down there” or “per!od.”  </p>\n<p>This linguistic regression harms health literacy and deepens shame around female anatomy, especially for Gen Z and Gen Alpha, who rely on these platforms for information.<br /><br />According to Carrie Kenyon, founder of Ouch!: </p>\n<blockquote><p>“There is something refreshing about a traditional print campaign as a call to arms against the online censorship of women's health. <br /><br />Using a range of visual icons, and with inspiration taken from the words themselves, we created this series to signal that all words associated to women's health are first and foremost good words.” </p></blockquote>\n<p> Taking a stand beyond the digital, the campaign’s print run acts as a symbol of leaving behind the very platforms perpetuating this censorship, reclaiming trusted physical spaces like GP offices, libraries, and community centres.  Alongside print, the free digital versions encourage sharing and reconquering of digital spaces through community-driven efforts on social media.  <br /><br /></p>",

Despite clear evidence and growing public concern, no meaningful response or action has been taken to date. <br /></p>\n<p>Key terms describing anatomy, menstrual health, menopause, and postpartum care are flagged as “adult content” or “unprofessional,” while equivalent male health language remains visible.  </p>\n<p>Further, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x07c50sE6KaT_jpLwE94k3hRg27Dm-65/view\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> by <a href=\"https://casanegra.studio/\" target=\"_blank\">CASANEGRA Studio</a> shows this goes beyond erasure, revealing how algorithmic content moderation distorts language and stifles vital health conversations.  </p>\n<p>Their analysis reveals an euphemism economy flourishing across social platforms, where medically precise terms like vulva, uterus, and period mutate into code words or symbols to evade banishment: “down there”, “seggs” or “that time of the month”.  As a result,  clinical language is now treated with the same severity as pornography, pushing women toward euphemisms like *“down there” or “per!od.”  </p>\n<p>This linguistic regression harms health literacy and deepens shame around female anatomy, especially for Gen Z and Gen Alpha, who rely on these platforms for information.<br /><br />According to Carrie Kenyon, founder of Ouch!: </p>\n<blockquote><p>“There is something refreshing about a traditional print campaign as a call to arms against the online censorship of women's health. <br /><br />Using a range of visual icons, and with inspiration taken from the words themselves, we created this series to signal that all words associated to women's health are first and foremost good words.” </p></blockquote>\n<p> Taking a stand beyond the digital, the campaign’s print run acts as a symbol of leaving behind the very platforms perpetuating this censorship, reclaiming trusted physical spaces like GP offices, libraries, and community centres.  Alongside print, the free digital versions encourage sharing and reconquering of digital spaces through community-driven efforts on social media.  <br /><br /></p>"
